[Season 1]
[Episode 1]
Walter: My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. To all law enforcement entities, this is not an admission of guilt. I am speaking to my family now. Skyler you are the love of my life. I hope you know that. Walter Junior you're my big man. There are going to be some things. Things that you'll come to learn about me in the next few days. I just want you to know that no matter how it may look, I only had you in my heart. Goodbye.

Scene: White Residence
(Three weeks earlier)

Skyler: Happy Birthday.

Walter: Look at that.

Skyler: That is veggie bacon. Believe it or not. Zero cholesterol. You won't even taste the difference. What time do you think you'll be home?

Walter: Same time.

Skyler: I don't want him dicking you around tonight. You get paid till 5, you work till 5, no later.

Walter: Hey.

Walter Jr: Happy birthday.

Walter: Well, thank you.

Skyler: You're late again.

Walter Jr: There was no hot water again.

Skyler: I have an easy fix for that. You wake up early, and then you get to be the first person in the shower.

Walter Jr: I have an idea. How about buy a new hot water heater? How's that idea? For the millionth and billionth time.

Skyler: Did you take your Echinacea?

Walter: Yeah. I think it's getting better.

Walter Jr: What the hell is this?

Walter: It's veggie bacon. We're watching our cholesterol, I guess.

Walter Jr: Not me. I want real bacon. Not this fake crap.

Skyler: Too bad. Eat it.

Walter Jr: This smells like Band-aids.

Skyler: Eat it.

Walter Jr: So, how's it feel to be old?

Walter: How does it feel to be a smart ass?

Walter Jr: Good.

Walter: Eat your veggie bacon.

Scene: High School Parking Lot

Walter: You all set?

Walter Jr: Yeah, I'm fine.

Walter: All right, see you at home.

Walter Jr: Okay, see you.

Scene: Walt’s Classroom

Walter: Chemistry. It is the study of what? Anyone? Ben.

Ben: Chemicals.

Walter: Chemicals! No! Chemistry is well, technically, chemistry is the study of matter. But I prefer to see it as the study of change. Now just just think about this. Electrons. They change their energy levels. Molecules. Molecules change their bonds. Elements. They combine and change into compounds. Well, that's all of life. Right? I mean, it's just It's the constant. It's the cycle. It's solution, dissolution, just over and over and over. It is growth, then decay, then transformation. It is fascinating, really. Chad, is there something wrong with your table? Okay. Ionic bonds Are you done? Ionic bonds. Chapter 6.

Scene: Car Wash

Walter: And 2, 3 makes 10, and 10 makes 20. Here's your receipt, and hand this claiming disc to your car wash professional. Thank you. Come again.

Bogdan: He's not coming. He said he quits. I'm gonna run the register.

Walter: Bogdan, no. We talked about this.

Bogdan: I'm shorthanded, Walter. What am I to do? Walter? What am I to do?

Chad: Hey, Mr. White! Make those tires shine, huh?

Chad’s Girlfriend: Oh, my God. You would not believe who's cleaning Chad's car. Mr. White from Chemistry.

Scene: White Residence

Everyone: Surprise!

Walter Jr: Happy Birthday, Dad!

Skyler: You're so very late.

Carmen: Really, I'm serious, Skyler. I mean, you're flat as a washboard. You look awesome. She's not showing at all, is she?

Marie: She's showing a little.

Skyler: Carmen, this is my sister Marie.

Carmen: Pleased to meet you.

Marie: Hi.

Hank: Glock 22. It's my daily carry, okay? I mean, unless you're talking, what, plus, P-plus loads, you can forget the 9-mil, all right? I’ve seen one of those bounce off a windshield one time.

Steve: Yeah, the way you sh**t.

Hank: If you're gonna bring a g*n, you gotta bring enough g*n. 40 caliber.

Walter Jr: This is awesome right here.

Hank: Nice, isn't it?

Walter Jr: Dad, come check this out.

Walter: Yeah, I see it.

Walter Jr: Come on, take it.

Hank: Check it out, Walt.

Walter: No, no, it's just heavy.

Hank: That's why they hire men. Jesus, it's not gonna bite you, all right? Looks like Keith Richards with a glass of warm milk, doesn't he? Hey, Walt. Everybody listen up, listen up, listen up! I'm gonna give a toast. A little toast to my brother-in-law. Come here. Walt, you got a brain the size of Wisconsin, but we're not gonna hold that against you. Because your heart's in the right place, man. Your heart's in the right place. We love you, man. We love you. Everybody! To Walt! Nostrovia!

Everyone: Nostrovia!

Hank: Oh shit, turn on Channel 3.

Hank(on the news): At which point we apprehended three individuals and placed them into custody. I'm proud to say the outstanding professionalism of my fellow agents at the Albuquerque District Office resulted in a substantial amount of methamphetamine being taken off the streets.

Reporter(on the news): Were any sh*ts fired?

Hank(on the news): No, ma'am. Our agents took the suspects by surprise.

Steve: Damn, the TV does add ten pounds.

Marie: Ten pounds?

Hank: Hey, sit and spin. Both of you.

Skyler: Hank.

Hank: What? Sorry. You didn't see that.

Skyler: So charming.

Hank(on the news): This is clearly an ongoing operation, one which was well organized.

Walter: Hank, how much money is that?

Hank: It's about 700 grand. That's a pretty good haul, huh?

Hank(on the news): As I say, it's a good day for the citizens of Albuquerque when we can put this big a dent in the local drug trade.

Walter: Wow. But that's unusual, isn't it, that kind of cash?

Hank: Well, it's not the most we ever took. It's easy money until we catch you. Walt, just say the word and I'll take you on a ride-along. You can watch us knock down a meth lab. Get a little excitement in your life.

Walter: Well, someday.

Scene: Walt and Skyler’s Bedroom

Walter: Which one's this?

Skyler: That faux-Lalique vase I picked up at the Super-Swap.

Walter: How's it doing?

Skyler: I met my reserve, and there's still two minutes.

Walter: What's up?

Skyler: You tell me, birthday boy. Oh, hey, so what's up for Saturday?

Walter: Car wash. Bogdan says he needs me.

Skyler: Until what time? Noon? 1-ish?

Walter: Probably 2, more like it.

Skyler: And then what after that?

Walter: Actually I was thinking of driving up to Los Alamos. The visitor center has an exhibit on that’s really supposed to be...

Skyler: You're not gonna paint?

Walter: I'll paint. It's just that this part of this exhibition on the Mars Rover photographs are the detail really is just supposed to be amazing.

Skyler: It's just that I really need you to paint at some point. I mean, the sooner that back bedroom gets finished. And I'd do it myself, except you said you don't want me standing on the stepladder.

Walter: I'll paint. I will paint.

Skyler: What is going on down there?

Walter: No, it's just...

Skyler: Is he asleep?

Walter: No, It's nothing. You know, just you know, we gotta be careful about the baby.

Skyler: Don't worry about the baby. This is just for you. We are just doing you tonight. So just close your eyes. Relax, and let it. Close your eyes.

Walter: Okay.

Skyler: There you go. That's it. That's it. There you go. Keep it going. Keep it going. Keep it going. Keep Yes! 56!

Scene: Ambulance

Walter: This is so embarrassing. I am fine. Honestly. It's just some bug going around. First my wife had it, then my son, and now me. It's just like a chest cold. Could be some low blood sugar as well. I didn't have the greatest breakfast this morning, honestly. Hey, listen, can you do me a favor? Can you just drop me off at a corner somewhere?

EMT: No. Sorry.

Walter: It's just that I don't have the greatest insurance.

EMT: Take a couple of deep breaths for me. Is there anybody you want us to contact for you?

Walter: God, no.

EMT: Lean forward for me, would you? Mr. White, are you a smoker?

Walter: No. Never. Why do you ask?

Scene: Doctor’s Office

Doctor: Mr. White. Mr. White?

Walter: Yes.

Doctor: You understood what I've just said to you?

Walter: Yes. Lung cancer. Inoperable.

Doctor: I'm sorry I just need to make sure you fully understand.

Walter: Best-case scenario, with chemo, I'll live maybe another couple years. It's just you've got mustard on your...right there. Mustard, there. Right there.

Scene: White Residence

Skyler: So my records show that I paid it, and I certainly don't feel that we owe any late...All right. Well, I'll check with the bank and maybe the post office, if they lost it or something. Yeah, let me look into that. Okay. Thank you. Did you use the MasterCard last month?

Walter: We needed printer paper.

Skyler: Walt, the MasterCard's the one we don't use.

Walter: Okay.

Skyler: So how was your day?

Walter: Oh, I don't know. I don't know. It was, um it was fine.

Scene: Car Wash

Bogdan: Come on. I'm shorthanded. I need you to do some wipe-downs. Come on.

Walter: What?

Bogdan: I said I need you outside to do some wipe-downs. Are you here to work or to be staring at the skies? Come on, let's go. Come on, man.

Walter: f*ck you, Bogdan.

Bogdan: What?

Walter: I said f*ck you! And your eyebrows! Wipe down this!

Scene: White Residence-backyard

Walter: Uh, Hank. Hank, it's Walt. Hey. Oh, listen I didn't wake you, did I? Oh, good, good. No, no, nothing's wrong. I just, uh I've been, uh, thinking about that offer that ride-along.

Scene: Hank’s Car

Hank: It's the last house on the right. See it? Not the two-story one. The one next to it. The kind of I don't know, what do you call that? Green?

Steve: Sage.

Hank: Sage. What, do you work at the f*cking Pottery Barn? Jesus.

Steve: Sage. That's the word for it. My fault the only word your dumb ass knows is green?

Hank: Cheese dick. I know that one. How 'bout that? Anyway, it's the sage one. See it?

Walter: So what tells you it's a meth lab?
Hank: Just our snitch. Says some dude goes by Cap'n Cook lives up to his name in there. Says he always adds a dash of chili powder. Ah, you exuberant Mexicans.

Steve: Uh-uh. Cap’n Cook, that's a white boy's name. Dopey as hell, too.

Hank: Yeah? Tell you what. I got 20 bucks that says he's a beaner.

Steve: All right. You're on.

Hank: All right, come on, come on. All right. School bus is clear. Got the green light.

Agent: Copy that.

Hank: Watch this. This makes 'em shit.

Agent: Go, go, go.

Hank: Meth labs are nasty on a good day. You mix that shit wrong, you got mustard gas.

Walter: Phosphine gas. I think.

Hank: Yeah, exactly. One whiff will k*ll you. That's why the respirators.

Agent: House is clear. One suspect in custody.

Hank: Copy that. The suspect, might he be of the Latino persuasion?

Agent: Driver's license says Emilio Koyama.

Steve: Asian! Pay up, sucker.

Hank: Hey hey hey! First name Emilio. That's at least half a beaner. Tell you what, I'll let you off for a 10. Cheer up, Gomey. You people still got J. Lo.

Walter: Hank, do you think I might get to go inside? See the actual lab?

Hank: Yeah. Yeah, I tell you what, we're gonna go peek our heads in, check it out first. Stay here a minute.

Jesse: God.

Walter: Oh, my God. Pinkman?

Scene: Jesse’s House

Walter: It's me. I'm alone.

Jesse: How'd you find me?

Walter: You're still in our filing system. So your aunt owns this place, right?

Jesse: I own it.

Walter: No one's looking for you.

Jesse: Why are you here?

Walter: I was curious. Honestly, I never expected you to amount to much, but methamphetamine? I didn't picture that. There's a lot of money in it, huh?

Jesse: I don't know what you're talking about.

Walter: No?

Jesse: Not a clue.

Walter: Cap'n Cook? That's not you? Like I said, no one is looking for you.

Jesse: Look, I don't know what you think you're doing here, Mr. White. I mean, if you're planning on giving me some bowl winder about getting right with Jesus by turning myself in...

Walter: Not really.

Jesse: High school was a long time ago. You ain't Welcome Back Kotter, so step off. No speeches.

Walter: Short speech. You lost your partner today. What's his name? Emilio? Emilio is going to prison. The DEA took all your money, your lab. You got nothing. Square 1. But you know the business. And I know the chemistry. I'm thinking maybe you and I could partner up.

Jesse: You want to cook crystal meth? You? You and, uh and me?

Walter: That's right. Either that or I turn you in.

Scene: White Residence

Marie: What the hell is this?

Skyler: Damned if I know. I described it as mosaic folk art.

Marie: Somebody bought it?

Skyler: Yeah, some guy in Minneapolis. 14 dollars plus shipping.

Marie: Yes! At this rate, in 50 or 60 years, you'll be rich. So how goes the novel?

Skyler: It's not a novel, actually, which I have...

Marie: You're not writing a novel? You told me you were.

Skyler: No. Short stories. I said that if eventually I have enough good ones that maybe I'll try and publish another collection.

Marie: Those really didn't sell. I just thought a novel would be easier to sell.

Skyler: Yeah, well, maybe so.

Marie: Ever want me to read anything, I could critique it for you.

Skyler: No. I mean, I'm not at that stage where I...no.

Marie: Open offer. So what's up with Walt lately?

Skyler: What do you mean? He's fine.

Marie: He just seems, I don't know, quieter than usual.

Skyler: Turning 50 is a big deal. I mean, I'm sure as hell not looking forward to 40. You're gonna be a complete basket case.

Marie: So it's a mid-life crisis.

Skyler: No, he's just quiet.

Marie: How's the sex?

Skyler: Marie, Jesus.

Marie: Guess that answers that.


Scene: Jesse’s House

Walter: You just gonna sit there? This. Look at this. Kjeldahl-style recovery flask, Very rare. You got your usual paraphernalia: Griffin beakers, your Erlenmeyer flask. But the piece de resistance: a round bottom boiling flask.

Jesse: Well, I cook in one of those. The big one.

Walter: One of these? No, this is a volumetric flask. You wouldn't cook in one of these.

Jesse: Yeah, I do.

Walter: No, you don't. A volumetric flask is for general mixing and titration. You wouldn't apply heat to a volumetric flask. That's what a boiling flask is for. Did you learn nothing from my chemistry class?

Jesse: No. You flunked me. Remember?

Walter: No wonder.

Jesse: Prick. Now let me tell you something else. This ain't chemistry, this is art. Cooking is art. And the shit I cook is the b*mb, so don't be telling me.

Walter: The shit you cook is shit. I saw your setup. Ridiculous. You and I will not make garbage. We will produce a chemically pure and s*ab product that performs as advertised. No adulterants. No baby formula. No chili powder.

Jesse: No, no, chili P is my signature.

Walter: Not anymore.

Jesse: Yeah, well, we'll see about that. What the hell is this?

Walter: Lab safety equipment. We're also gonna have an emergency eye wash station. These chemicals and their fumes are toxic, in case you didn't know that.

Jesse: Well, you can dress up like a f*g if you want. Not me. Listen, this stuff doesn't stay more than a day.

Walter: What? I thought we were gonna cook here.

Jesse: No, we're not gonna cook here. Okay, this is my house. I don't shit where I eat.

Walter: Well, then, where are we gonna work?

Jesse: You tell me. This is your deal. You want to smoke it up, smoke it up at your house. Nah, I didn't think so.

Walter: Oh, well. Well what if we rented one of those self-storage places, you know, those little orange garages, worked out of there?

Jesse: No. They're on to that. They got dogs that sniff around. RV. That's what you want.

Walter: What, like a Winnebago?

Jesse: Yeah. I know a dude who wants to sell his. He just goes camping with it. But a mobile meth lab? That'd be the b*mb. I mean, drive way out in the boonies. Be all evasive.

Scene: Bank Parking Lot

Jesse: Dude, this isn't even 7 grand. My guy wants 85.

Walter: This is all the money I have in the world. You're a drug dealer. Negotiate.

Jesse: You are not how I remember you from class, I mean, like, not at all.

Walter: I gotta go.

Jesse: Wait, wait. Hold on. Tell me why you're doing this. Seriously.

Walter: Why do you do it?

Jesse: Money, mainly.

Walter: There you go.

Jesse: Nah, come on! Man, some straight like you, giant stick up his ass, all of a sudden at age, what, 60, he's just gonna break bad?

Walter: I'm 50.

Jesse: It's weird is all, okay? It doesn't compute. Listen if you've gone crazy or something I mean, if you've if you've gone crazy or depressed, I'm just saying that's something I need to know about. Okay? I mean, that affects me.

Walter: I am awake.

Jesse: What?

Walter: Buy the RV. We start tomorrow.

Scene: The Mall

Skyler: How's it coming in there?

Walter Jr: Fine.

Skyler: Do you want me or your dad?

Walter Jr: Dad.

Skyler: So how are those feeling in the waist? Are they too tight? 'Cause you don't want to get 'em if they're too tight.

Walter Jr: They're pre-shrunk.

Skyler: Are you sure you don't want to get a different kind? Like, you know, the skinny jeans? Those are really supposed to be in style now. The skaters wear them.

Walter Jr: Do I look like a skater?

Skyler: All right.

Teenager: Mom, look at my big-boy pants. Mommy, could you zip up my big-boy pants?

Walter: Don't.

Skyler: What?

Walter: Don't.

Skyler: Walt.

Walter Jr: Where...

Skyler: I have no idea. You know what? Don't even look at them. They're obviously very stupid. Yep. I think that, um I think those jeans look really good on you. You should get 'em if you like 'em, okay? Why don't you just hang out here for a second? I'll be right back.

Walter Jr: Fine.

Teenager: Mommy, I think I pinched a loaf in my brand-new big-boy pants. What are you doing?

Walter: What's wrong, chief? Having a little trouble walking?

Teenager: Get off me. Get off me! I'll mess you up, man.

Walter: Well, you'll have one sh*t. You better make it good. What, are you waiting for your girlfriends? You better go. Take it. Take your sh*t. Take it! Come on. Come on.

Teenager: Come on, let's get outta here. Let's go. Psycho.

Scene: Desert

Jesse: Yeah, nothing but cows! Got some big cow house way out that way, like 2 miles, but I don't see nobody.

Walter: Cow house?

Jesse: Yeah, where they live. The cows. Whatever, man. Yeah, let's cook here.

Walter: Cow house. God help me.

Jesse: What are you doing?

Walter: These are my good clothes. I can't go home smelling like a meth lab.

Jesse: Yeah, you can. I do. Those? Those, uh You're keeping those on, right?

Walter: Come on. Daylight's burning.

Jesse: Oh, my God. Oh, this is, uh this is a good look for you. And you're maybe only the world's second biggest h*m*.

Walter: Would you shut up and help me?

Jesse: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, work it. Baby, work it.

Walter: Turn that off!

Jesse: This is glass grade. I mean, you got...Jesus, you got crystals in here two inches, three inches long. This is pure glass. You're a g*dd*mn artist. This is art, Mr. White.

Walter: Actually, it's just basic chemistry, but thank you, Jesse. I'm glad it's acceptable.

Jesse: Acceptable? You're the g*dd*mn Iron Chef. Every jibhead from here to Timbuktu is going to want a taste. Now I gotta try this.

Walter: No. No. No, we only sell it. We don't use it.

Jesse: Okay, since when? Listen, you've been watching way too much Miami Vice. That ain't happening.

Walter: So what now? How do we proceed?

Jesse: We cook more tomorrow. Meantime I know just the guy to talk to.

Scene: Krazy-8’s House

Jesse: Kraze, how you doing, my man? You got a new dog. Right on, man. What's his name? Yeah, I had a dog like that once, except maybe, like, twice as big. Super purebred. Now, me personally, I would train him to go straight for the nuts...

Krazy-8: Just shut your mouth and show me your money.

Jesse: I ain't buying, ese. I'm selling. Tell me that ain't the finest scante you ever laid eyes on. Go ahead, try it. Hey, poochie. How you doing? Jesus Christ. See? What'd I say?

Krazy-8: It's all right.

Jesse: It's all right? It's all right?

Krazy-8: Yeah, it's all right. So, what? You back in business?

Jesse: Hell, yeah, I'm back. With a vengeance. Vato loco gotta make a living. You know, with your cousin gone away and all. And listen, homes, about that. It really broke me up about Emilio. That dude is like my brother. He okay? You talk to him?

Krazy-8: Yeah, yeah, I talked to him. He said when the Feds came, you were out sticking it in some neighbor lady.

Jesse: Hey, you know, I got lucky twice.

Krazy-8: I don't know, man. Emilio, he thinks maybe you dimed on him.

Jesse: That is bullshit. That is bullshit, Krazy-8! I should kick his punk ass for even thinking that. You know what? Next time you talk to Emilio, you tell him for me, all right?

Krazy-8: Why don't you tell him yourself? Made bail this morning.

Emilio: Go ahead, pendejo. Kick my ass.

Jesse: Hey, listen...

Krazy-8: Where did you get this? Because I know your little punk ass didn't cook it.

Scene: Desert

Krazy-8: Hey, man. You some kind of nudist? That's some stone-fine tick tick you been cooking there, ese. How about you come work for me?

Krazy-8: You out here all by yourself, huh?

Emilio: I know you. He was there when I got busted. He's with the DEA!

Walter: No.

Emilio: You ratasnitch f*ck!

Jesse: Run, Mr. White! Run!

Emilio: I say we cap 'em both.

Krazy-8: Hey, you really cook up that batch?

Walter: Yeah.

Krazy-8: You an artist. It's a damn shame.

Walter: Wait! Wait a minute. Listen to me. I'll teach you my recipe. What do you say? You want to cook like me? You let us both live and I will teach you. Put the cigarette out. Please.

Emilio: Move it, homes. We ain't got all day.

Walter: Okay.

Jesse: What happened? What'd you do to them?

Walter: Red phosphorus in the presence of moisture and accelerated by heat yields phosphorus hydride. Phosphine gas. One good whiff and...we gotta, we gotta clean this up.

Scene: Walt and Skyler’s Bedroom

Skyler: Where were you? Walt. I don't know what's been going on with you lately, but...

Walter: Nothing. I'm fine.

Skyler: Whatever it is, I'll tell you this. I do not like it when you don't talk to me. The worst thing you can do is shut me out. Walter, is that you?

Scene: Desert
Twelve Hours Earlier

Walter: You are a lifesaver.

Jesse: Yeah, man.

Walter: We can't thank you enough.

Jesse: Hey, mad props.

Walter: I could have sworn the guy said south. But then, all of a sudden we're off the main road. I'm trying to read the map while I'm driving, which is a bonehead maneuver. And all of a sudden bam, we're in that ditch.

Jesse: Yeah, bam, I'm like, what the hell? You know?

Walter: Yes, and my coffee mug. Coffee? My mug of coffee? It spills all over my pants. I mean, just a nightmare.

Jesse: Dude, you so need GPS. I mean, for real.

Walter: Like I said, we couldn't be more grateful.

Jesse: Can't we just dump 'em here?

Walter: What, then somebody finds them? Then what? People have seen us.

Jesse: You're gonna flood it, man.

Walter: I'm not gonna flood it. She's not gonna flood, all right? We're just gonna stay positive, right? We're going to clean up this mess. Wish you would start.

Jesse: Damn it. See? You flooded it.

Walter: All right. All right. You know what? The RV is going to start now. The RV is going to start right now. It's gonna start and we're gonna drive it over to your house.

Jesse: My house?

Walter: Yes. We'll drive it over there and park it overnight. And then tomorrow...

Jesse: No, man, not my house!

Walter: Shut up! After we finish cleaning up this mess, we will go our separate ways. Our paths will never cross. And we will tell this to no one. Understood?

Jesse: What, I can talk now? Fine. That goes double for me.

Walter: Be good to me. Oh, shit.

Scene: White Residence (Bathroom)

Skyler: Walt? You coming out?

Walter: Yeah, absolutely.

Scene: White Residence (Dining Room)

Walter: You wanna hear something funny? We had a faculty meeting last Thursday and the topic was senior class photos, and how we had instituted a new rule last year that seniors are allowed to have photos taken by a photographer of their choice. Not necessarily the photographer that the school hires, right? So anyway, some of the senior girls were going to that Glamour sh*ts place, to have their photos taken, and now they're bringing us all these photos, and Joan Epperman, you know Joan, suddenly has to go through all these photos and turn them down, because they show cleavage.

Skyler: Did you get enough pancakes, sweetie?

Walter Junior: Yeah. I'm good.

Walter: You know, even these small-busted girls have cleavage. Apparently there's some new type of brassiere, or something.

Walter Junior: The Wonderbra. It's the Wonderbra.

Walter(Answering Machine): Hey, there. You've reached Walt, Skyler and Walter Junior. We can't come to the phone right now, so please leave us a message.

Jesse: Hello, Mr. White. This is AT&T calling. Are you happy with your current long distance service? 'Cause if you're not, I would definitely, really love to talk to you as soon as possible about...

Walter: Hello? Hello. This is Walter White speaking.

Jesse: You said he was practically d*ad, okay? You said he would die any minute!

Walter: Listen, I am having breakfast with my family right now, and I really don't appreciate these sales calls.

Jesse: Well, too bad, man, 'cause guess what. He's still not d*ad! I went and put my ear to the RV, I can hear him, like, rolling around in there, all right? I think he's awake, man, I think he's trying to get loose. Where the hell are you? I'm freaking out over here!

Walter: Calm down, damn it.

Jesse: Are you gonna help me clean this up? We got loose ends here!

Walter: Calm down! I will be there after school.

Jesse: After school? Are you sh1tting me? Ditch it, man, call in sick.

Walter: Listen, that is just not going to work for me. I'm not interested in that at all. And I would appreciate it if you don't call here anymore. Damn. They're so annoying, those people.

Skyler: You have a good day, sweetie.

Walter Junior: Okay, Mom. You too.

Skyler: Bye, honey. Drive safe.

Walter: Okay.

Jesse(Answering Machine): Yo, yo, yo, 148-3369, representing the ABQ. What up, biatch? Leave it at the tone.

Scene: Walter’s Classroom

Walter: So, the term "chiral" derives from the Greek word "hand. " The concept here being that, just as your left hand, and your right hand are mirror images of one another, right? Identical, and yet opposite. Well, so too organic compounds can exist as mirror image forms of one another all the way down at the molecular level. But although they may look the same, they don't always behave the same. For instance...I'm sorry for instance Thalidomide. The right-handed isomer of the drug, Thalidomide is a perfectly fine good medicine to give to a pregnant woman to prevent morning sickness but, make the mistake of giving that same pregnant woman the left-handed isomer of the drug Thalidomide, and her child will be born with horrible birth defects. Which is precisely what happened in the 1950s. So, chiral, chirality, mirrored images, right? Active, inactive. Good, bad. Yes, Ben?

Ben: Is this gonna be on the m*rder?

Walter: What?

Ben: Is this gonna be on the mid-term?

Walter: The chirality on the mid-term? No, no, well, maybe, maybe, yes, you know, but prepare for it to be on the mid-term. Can't hurt to know it, right? Knowledge is power!

Scene: Jesse’s House

Jesse: Oh, no, no not good. Not good.

Scene: Walter’s Car

Walter: What the...hey, you. Listen No, no, no, no! Oh, God!

Scene: White Residence

Skyler: MILF's? What the hell is a MILF?

Scene: Jesse’s Living Room

Walter: Now what? The other one, out in the RV, he's...You're sure?

Jesse: Yes.

Walter: Positive?

Jesse: Feel free to go check it yourself.

Walter: Yes, good idea. Maybe I should do that before he, too, wanders off on the damn street!

Jesse: Okay, you know what, I…

Walter: All right, all right! The one downstairs, tell me about him. Come on, anything, something! Start with his name, at least!

Jesse: Krazy-8.

Walter: Krazy-8? What the hell does that even mean?

Jesse: I don't know, man, okay? I mean, he's like, Krazy-8, okay? I don't know.

Walter: So, you work with him regularly?

Jesse: No, not him so much. His cousin, mainly.

Walter: Who's his cousin?

Jesse: The guy out in the RV!

Walter: All right, all right.

Jesse: Krazy-8's one level higher.

Walter: One level higher?

Jesse: Yeah, you know, not like street level. Higher. You know, there's like a Starbucks at every corner? Krazy-8 is, like, the dude that sells Starbucks his beans.

Walter: Okay, so he's a distributor. Okay, so, is he, I mean, is he in other words what is his reputation for v*olence?

Jesse: Well, um he did try to k*ll us both yesterday, so there's that.

Walter: What I'm trying to say is that he's a distributor, right? He's a businessman, he's a man of business. It would therefore seem to follow that he is capable of acting out of mutual self-interest, yes?

Jesse: What?

Walter: Do you think he is capable of listening to reason?

Jesse: What kind of reason? Like "Dear Krazy-8, listen, "if I let you go, will you promise not to come back and waste my family? "No Colombian neckties. " You mean that kind of reason? No, man, I can't say I have high f*cking hopes where that's concerned. What was that? What was what? Come see! We gotta tie him up. Why the hell didn't we tie him up?

Walter: Because he was out cold.

Jesse: But what if he's faking it? Like if it was me, I'd be all faking being knocked out, yo! And then, when the coast is clear, I'd be up looking for w*apon and shit, waiting to pounce!

Scene: Basement

Jesse: Now if it was me, and I couldn't find a decent enough w*apon, I would just lie back down, and bide my time.

Scene: Jesse’s Living Room

Jesse: So now what do we do?

Walter: You keep asking me that like you think I have some answer.

Jesse: Well, you gotta do something!

Walter: We! We have got to do something, and I am opened to suggestions.

Jesse: Man, uh-uh, okay, this whole thing was your deal!

Walter: Don't you dare put that on me! You brought those guys out there, this is your responsibility!

Jesse: Like I came to you, begging to cook meth. "Hey nerdiest old dude I know, you wanna come cook crystal? Please! I'd ask my diaper-wearing granny, but her wheelchair wouldn't fit in the RV. " What about the phosphate gas?

Walter: Phosphine gas. What about it?

Jesse: I mean, do you think it still might k*ll him? You know, with like a delayed reaction or something?

Walter: I don't know.

Jesse: You're supposed to be a scientist!

Walter: Look! This isn't even the issue that demands immediate attention. We have got a body in that RV, and it's getting warmer outside, understand? And we have got to do something about that soon. And in a way that no one will ever find it. Now that last part is very, very important. Therefore, it seems to me that our best course of action would be chemical disincorporation. Dissolving in strong acid.

Jesse: Oh man, that's messed up. You're not serious? You're serious? Who's gonna do that? And don't look at me!

Walter: I guess we'll both do it together.

Jesse: No, Mr. White, okay, I'm not good with d*ad bodies.

Walter: We're in this 50/50, okay? I guess the only other fair way to go about this would be that one of us deals with the body situation, while the other one of us deals with the Krazy-8 situation. In a scenario like this, I don't suppose it is bad form to just flip a coin. Heads or tails?

Jesse: I'll do the body in the acid, okay?

Walter: Heads or tails?

Jesse: Heads.

Walter: Best two out of three?

Jesse(Answering Machine): Yo, yo, yo, 148-3369, representing the ABQ. What up, biatch? Leave it at the tone.

Jesse: Mr. White, it's me, pick up. I got a container question. Hello? Mr. White, pick up the phone, man!

Walter: Yes?

Jesse: What kind of plastic, man?

Walter: Polyethylene.

Jesse: How the hell am I supposed to know that?

Walter: Because I told you. Look, just look at the bottom for a triangle stamped "LDPE. " It should be molded right into the plastic.

Jesse: Yeah, yeah, LDPE. Right on, got it. But I don't know, man, this feels kind of flimsy. Any decent acid's gonna eat right through this.

Walter: Not hydrofluoric.

Jesse: Why not?

Walter: Look, you skipped, clowned around or otherwise jerked off to every lecture I ever gave. As far as I'm concerned, your chemistry education is over.

Jesse: Oh, okay. Be a dick about it. So, hey, have you done the thing?

Walter: Yeah, I'm working up to it.

Jesse: You know what? I bet he doesn't even wake up. Not even if you took him to the hospital right now. Now, if it was me, I would just try and think of it like I was doing him a favor.

Scene: Basement

Krazy-8: Who's there? Don't you f*cking play games with me. Who's there? Yeah, I see you. What are you gonna do? I need water! Bring me some water, would you? Please?

Walter: You don't like the crust?

Krazy-8: Where's my cousin Emilio? He d*ad?

Scene: Jesse’s Kitchen

Jesse: Hey, Mr. White! Mr. White? Are you smoking weed? Oh, my God! Wait a minute. Is that my weed? What the hell, man? Make yourself at home, why don't you?

Walter: So what did you end up buying?

Jesse: Nothing. No store in town sells a plastic bin big enough for a body.

Walter: I don't suppose you could buy two bins. Legs in one, torso in the other?

Jesse: God. I don't suppose you could kiss my ass? How did it go? So you didn't do it?

Walter: Not yet. God. I gotta go.

Jesse: What? No, come back here!

Walter: Sorry. I'll do it tomorrow, I promise.

Jesse: Tomorrow?

Walter: I've got a doctor's appointment, I gotta go. Look, stay away from him. He's awake.

Jesse: Hey, man, we flipped a coin. We flipped a coin!

Scene: Doctor’s Appointment

Skyler: We're good?

Doctor: We're very good. We're excellent, I'd say. Oh, would you look at that face! Smile, peanut! So, who's up for knowing? Girl.

Skyler: Girl?

Walter: You sure?

Doctor: Pretty sure.

Walter: Can I tell you this is exactly what I was hoping?

Skyler: You remember you said that when she's 16 and starts dating.

Doctor: Looking fabulous. Let me see if they're done with the blood sugar, then we'll get you out. I'll be right back.

Skyler: Who is Jesse Pinkman?

Walter: Jesse?

Skyler: Jesse Pinkman. He called just this morning, Walt, please don't deny it. It says on his MyShout page he attended Wynne. Was he one of your students?

Walter: Yeah. He was nobody.

Skyler: Who is he to you? Why is he calling? What is this big secret you seem to be discussing with some druggie burn-out? You don't come home last night until 2 in the morning, you don't tell me where you've been. You spent the entire night in the bathroom, Walt. Tell me what's going on with you. Don't you think you owe me that? Who's this Jesse Pinkman to you?

Walter: He sells me pot.

Skyler: He sells you pot?

Walter: Marijuana, yeah. Not a lot. I mean, I don't know. I kinda like it.

Skyler: Are you out of your mind? What are you, like 16 years old? Your brother-in-law is a DEA agent. What is wrong with you?

Walter: Skyler I just haven't quite been myself lately.

Skyler: Yeah, no shit. Thanks for noticing.

Walter: I haven't been myself lately, but I love you. Nothing about that has changed. Nothing ever will. So right now, what I need is for you to climb down out of my ass. Can you do that? Will you do that for me, honey? Will you, please, just once, get off my ass? You know, I'd appreciate it. I really would.

Scene: Walter’s Classroom

Walter: Stop! Stop in 15 minutes.

Scene: Jesse’s Driveway

Jesse: Just meat, is all. Just a bunch of meat. Oh, Jesus. It's cool, you're cool. You're all good, yo. You're all good in the hood. It's fine. Just a bunch of meat, come on. You got it.

Skyler: Excuse me! Excuse me? You. Yes, you. May I talk to you?

Jesse: This is private property!

Skyler: Just a minute. I wanna talk to you.

Jesse: No, I'm not interested.

Skyler: Hey, don't touch me! Do not touch me.

Jesse: All right, look, not touching, okay? Not touching here. Look, lady, whatever you're selling, I ain't buying, yo.

Skyler: Well, my name is Skyler White, yo. My husband is Walter White, yo. He told me everything.

Jesse: Seriously?

Skyler: That's right. And just so you know My brother-in-law is a DEA agent. And I will not hesitate to call him. Not if I have to. Understood? This is your one and only warning. Do not sell marijuana to my husband. Okay. I mean it. Don't call our house again. You stay away from him, or you'll be one sorry individual. You got me?

Jesse: I think so, yeah. No more marijuana. I can dig it.

Skyler: You can dig it. Wonderful. Not that it's any of my business, but you might wanna consider a different line of work.

Jesse: Okay.

Scene: Jesse’s Bathroom

Jesse: "Let's go to your house, yo!” Makes perfect sense. "Let's completely screw up your house so you never wanna spend another night in it.” Sure. You know, why not? "And then, how about I send over my psycho-bitch wife to you know, break your balls and thr*at you?” God, that'd be hilarious. "And then, the k*ller in the basement? The one who's completely my responsibility? Hell, let's just let him live down there. Just, I don't know, make sure to feed him, like three times a day.” Sure, why not? That would be amazing. Thank you so much for the opportunity. I always dreamt about, I don't know, melting bodies!

Scene: Jesse’s Kitchen

Jesse: You got a brother in the goddamned DEA?

Walter: What?

Jesse: You said you were just doing some ride-along. Yes or no, do you have a brother in the DEA?

Walter: Brother-in-law.

Jesse: Now there's a load off my mind.

Walter: Where did you hear that?

Jesse: Your freaking wife told me when she was here all up on my shit. Yeah, that's right. She almost caught me moving Emilio! Good job in wearing the pants in the family. And why did you go and tell her I was selling you weed?

Walter: Because somehow, it seemed preferable to admitting that I cooked crystal meth and k*lled a man. Is that what I think it is?

Jesse: Yeah, it is. I smoked a bowl, so what? My house, my rules. Hey, no, no! Don't give me that, okay? I held up my end. I already took care of Emilio. You're still diddling around, trying to get your nut up. Well, boo-hoo.

Walter: I have the truly awful job here.

Jesse: You wanna talk awful? You wanna go there? Try dragging 200 pounds of stink up a flight of stairs. I barely got him in the bathtub!

Walter: Bathtub? What do you mean, "bathtub"?

Jesse: That's another thing. Why you got me running around town, trying to find some stupid piece of plastic, when I have a perfectly good tub I can use?

Walter: Oh, God. I'm sorry, what were you asking me? Oh, yes. That stupid plastic container I asked you to buy. You see, hydrofluoric acid won't eat through plastic. It will however dissolve metal, rock, glass, ceramic. So there's that.

[Episode 3]
Scene: Flashback of Walter and Gretchen at CalTech

Walter: Let's break it down. Hydrogen. What does that give us?

Gretchen: By mole? We're looking at 63%.

Walter: 63? Wow that is a big bite. My next step's gotta be oxygen.

Gretchen: Oxygen: 26%.

Walter: 26. There you have your water.

Gretchen: Carbon: 9%.

Walter: Carbon: 9.

Gretchen: For a total of 98%?

Walter: Right.

Gretchen: Nitrogen: 1.25%.

Walter: 1.25.

Gretchen: That brings it to 99 and a quarter. Which only leaves you with the trace elements down where the magic happens.

Walter: Oh, wait a minute. What about calcium? Calcium's not a trace. Got a whole skeleton to account for.

Gretchen: You would think, right?

Walter: Right.

Gretchen: Calcium. Calcium is only .25%.

Walter: What? That low? Seriously? Damn, I never would have thought that. Okay, so where does iron fit in?

Gretchen: Iron. Wow, okay. .00004%.

Walter: What? You can't have hemoglobin without iron.

Gretchen: Apparently, it don't take much.

Walter: No, it don't. Go figure. Sodium.

Gretchen: Sodium: .04. Phosphorus: .19.

Walter: .19. There we go. So, the whole thing adds up to 99.888042%. We are .111958% shy.

Gretchen: Supposedly that's everything.

Walter: Yeah? I don't know. Just seems like something's missing, doesn't it? There got to be more to a human being than that.

Scene: White Residence (Nursery)

Marie: I hate these shoes. These shoes make me look like I should be changing bedpans, like I should be squeaking around bringing soup to some disgusting old person, then take the bus home to my 16 cats.

Walter Junior: Then why are you wearing them?

Marie: I like the support. My arches happen to be extremely archy.

Walter Junior: Yo. What's up? Hey, can you call me, like, in two minutes? Thanks. Bye. Gotta go take this.

Skyler: Female?

Walter Junior: Louis. Not like it's any of your business, though.

Skyler: Just be quick about it. Oh, and, um, please don't say yo. You can't know how much I hate that.

Marie: You missed a spot right there. Should you be up on that ladder?

Skyler: You're more than welcome to take over for me up here.

Marie: I don't see why you don't just get Walt to do it.

Skyler: Yeah. There's an idea. So, I'm working on this new short story, and there's this stoner character in it, and I'm trying to, well, know you, actually, let me backup. You've smoked your fair share of pot in college, didn't you? I mean, you at least tried it. Come on.

Marie: I perhaps tried it. Why?

Skyler: Do you remember it having an effect on your mood, like changing it in any major way, or…

Marie: It made me more serious.

Skyler: Really? Because I mostly remember it made me light-headed. That's about it. I was just wondering if it maybe could you know, it's just a character thing I'm stuck on. Never mind.

Marie: Walter Jr. is on pot?

Skyler: What? No! No. What would make you even…

Marie: Where's he getting it from?

Skyler: Marie. Seriously.

Marie: Is it this Louis person? What are you going to do about this?

Skyler: You need to look me in the eye. I am strictly asking about a story that I am writing, that's all. Right hand to God, Walter Jr. is not on pot. Certainly not as far as I know.

Marie: Not as far as you know?

Skyler: Marie.

Scene: Jesse’s Basement

Krazy-8: Look at me. Hey, turn around and look at me. This here I wouldn't do this to my worst enemy. This is degrading.

Walter: I'm sorry.

Krazy-8: You hope I'll make it easy on you and just drop d*ad, don't you? Well, I won't. So either k*ll me or let me go. You don't have it in you, Walter.

Walter: How do you know my name?

Krazy-8: Jesse. He told Emilio and me.

Walter: When he came by to sell your meth? So what? You thr*at him, huh? Did you b*at it out of him?

Krazy-8: Not even close.

Walter: What else did he tell you?

Krazy-8: Pretty much everything you can think of. How you were his high school teacher. How one time you taught about carbon dioxide by making grape soda in class. How you have a son who's ret*rd, or in a wheelchair or something. This shouldn't come across as some news flash. That partner of yours he's got a big mouth. Walter, I don't know what you think you're doing here, but trust me, this line of work doesn't suit you.

Walter: So I should just let you go, then? Just unlock you and adios, huh?

Krazy-8: I don't see what real choice you have if it's between that and cold-blooded m*rder. Besides, your real problem is sitting upstairs.

Scene: Jesse’s Bathroom

Jesse: Occupied! Hey, yo, I'm trying to pinch one off in here! Just give me some privacy, would ya? What the hell, man? What are you doing, man? You assh*le!

Walter: You told him my name.

Jesse: Says who? Him?

Walter: My name, where I work. You told him about my son!

Jesse: Don't touch me!

Walter: Damn junkie!

Jesse: No, give me that!

Walter: Too late! This is going down the toilet. Watch it go!

Jesse: No, that's worth 40 grand, you stupid shit.

Walter: It's worth nothing when you smoke it all. Get off the toilet. Get off the toilet! Get off the toilet! Stop it!

Jesse: No! No way!

Walter: Where the hell do you think you're going?

Jesse: Back off, man! Jesus!

Walter: We've got work to do!

Jesse: No, you got work to do. I did my part.

Walter: You mean that obscenity that I spent the last two hours cleaning up? That is your contribution?

Jesse: Yo! Kiss my pink ass, man! I didn't ask for any of this! How am I supposed to live here now, huh? My whole house smells like toe cheese and dry cleaning.

Walter: Because you didn't follow my instructions!

Jesse: Oh, well, heil h*tler, bitch. And let me tell you something else. We flipped a coin, okay? You and me. You and me! Coin flip is sacred.

Walter: Damn it.

Jesse: Your job is waiting for you in that basement, as per the coin. f*cking do it already.

Scene: Clothing Store

Employee: That's what she said. Yeah, I think we have some of those. Yeah, you'll have to try them on. Hello. 7 and 1/2, maybe. I don't know.

Marie: Excuse me. Do you have these in black?

Employee: Anyway, so like I was saying, I went to the party the other night. Yeah, Tony was there.

Marie: Hey, where have you been? I called you two hours ago.

Hank: Sorry, baby. I'm kinda busy here. What's up?

Marie: Kind of a lot, actually, and it's a delicate subject, so I need you to focus and...

Hank: Hey, sit down! Sit down!

Marie: Damn it, Hank.

Hank: Well, sorry, babe. I'm just kind of in the middle of something here. Sit down! Sit your ass down! Comprende? You, too! Sit down! Sientete! I'm back, baby. What's up?

Marie: Walter Jr.

Hank: Yeah, what about him?

Marie: Marijuana. He's smoking it.

Hank: Bullshit.

Marie: Excuse me. His own mother seems to think so.

Hank: Skyler told you that?

Marie: She inferred it.

Hank: She inferred it, huh?

Marie: She strongly inferred it, like "Doctor, my friend suffers from erectile dysfunction." Please, come on already. I want you to talk to him.

Hank: Walt should. Skyler, better yet. She'll kick his butt up and down the block.

Marie: I think it ought to be you. You know, tell him some horror stories. Maybe show him some autopsy pictures.

Hank: What, autopsy for a pot overdose? Come on. I don't know, baby. It's just that, you know I figure his dad should be the one doing this thing, don't you think?

Marie: Hank, he respects you.

Hank: Yeah, all right. Well, listen, I'll swing by their place after work.

Marie: Good. Scare him straight.

Hank: Where's my sugar?

Employee: Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am. You need to be wearing footies before you try those on.

Marie: I'm extremely clean.

Employee: Yeah, well, I'd really appreciate it. Hey, sorry about that. Yeah, I'll check. You know, I hid a pair for you last week, gray ones, but my manager found them, and we had to put them back on the floor.

Scene: Motel Parking Lot

Hank: What do you think?

Walter Junior: About what?

Hank: This look like a nice place?

Walter Junior: No, not really.

Hank: Think you'd like to live here?

Walter Junior: No.

Hank: You sure about that?

Walter Junior: Yeah, pretty sure. I thought we were going to Cold Stone Creamery.

Hank: Well, a little detour. Figured we'd come over here and check out how the other half lives. This here's what we call the Crystal Palace. Now you know who lives in the palace? Meth-heads. Nasty, skeevy, meth-heads who'd sell their grandma's coochie for a h*t. Oh, you think that's funny? That's funny, huh? Yeah. Well, let me tell you something. Every last one of these miserable wastes of skin got started how? How do you think they got started?

Walter Junior: I don't know.

Hank: What do you think it was they were all doing before they graduated to sh**ting meth in their dicks? A gateway drug. That's what we call it. Dollars to doughnuts, and I shit you not, that gateway drug was marijuana. Every time. You understand?

Walter Junior: Um, yeah. So why are you telling me this?

Hank: 'Cause I love you, you little bastard. Hey, I was young once, you know? The world's a messed up place, you know? You know, there was this one time when...Hey! Hey! Hey, you! Yeah, you, princess! Get over here! Don't make me get out of the car! Check this out. See what I'm talking about.

Wendy: I ain't holdin', okay?

Hank: Did I say you could open your mouth? And hands off the car. Other side. Go around the other side. Talk to my friend here. What's your name, sweetheart?

Wendy: Wendy.

Hank: Wendy, huh? How much do you charge for a windy, Wendy?

Wendy: I ain't doing him. He's a kid.

Hank: Jesus, was that my question? Don't think so hard. It's gonna hurt your brain. Are you on the pipe or the needle?

Wendy: Nothing. Neither.

Hank: Show us your teeth, huh? Come on, Wendy, let's see those pearly whites. Oh, God. See that? Pipe. Definitely. Big time. Big time on the pipe. You got something you wanna ask Wendy?

Walter Junior: No, not really.

Hank: You ever smoked anything else, Wendy? Sausages don't count. Seriously. Tell my friend here how you got started. You probably used to be, what, like, a Girl Scout or probably sang in a church choir?

Wendy: What are you, like, handicapped?

Hank: He broke his leg playing football. He's a QB. Got an arm like a howitzer. So tell me, Wendy, do you smoke pot?

Wendy: Why, you got some?

Hank: All right. Hoof it. Get lost. Get out of here. Hey, fair warning! Next time I'm gonna bust you! So what do you think?

Walter Junior: Cool.

Scene: Motel Room

Jesse: Shut the door. Lock it. Lock it. Who the hell was that?

Wendy: A cop and some football player messing with me.

Jesse: They ask about me? Huh?

Wendy: No. I think they just wanted pot. Oh, shit. I left my root beer.

Scene: Jesse’s House

Skyler: Hello.

Walter: Hey, sweetie, it's me. Listen, I'm so sorry. The time, it just completely got away from me there. My fault. My fault. Bogdan just kept me here late, you know, doing some inventory, and I've I should have just you know, you're right. I gotta learn to say, you know, no! But, um Sky? You there?

Skyler: You're at the car wash?

Walter: Yeah.

Skyler: I seriously doubt that, since you quit two weeks ago. I called Bogdan, looking for you. Quite an earful he gave me.

Walter: Listen, listen, I'll come home, and we'll talk about it.

Skyler: I don't think so, Walt. Honey. Wherever you are why don't you just stay there tonight?

Walter: Skyler? Skyler? Skyler?

Krazy-8: Walter! Kind of hungry down here! Damn. I didn't think you were coming back.

Walter: How long was I out?

Krazy-8: 10, 15 minutes. I've never seen someone knock themselves out just by coughing. You breathe in the same thing you used on me?

Walter: I've got lung cancer. I'll go make you another sandwich. It's safe. There's no poison.

Krazy-8: Yeah? Because that'd be the way to do it if you're gonna do it. I suppose it would. I mean, you being a chemist and all.

Walter: So that name Krazy-8. Do I really have to call you that? I mean, no offense, but don't you have a real name?

Krazy-8: Domingo.

Walter: Domingo. That's Sunday, right? I'd rather call you that, if you don't mind.

Krazy-8: Yeah, whatever. I can't say I ever liked it much.

Walter: So, Domingo are you from around town here or someplace else?

Krazy-8: Walter, you getting to know me is not gonna make it easier for you to k*ll me. Not that I mind, you understand.

Walter: You know, you keep telling me that I don't have it in me. Well, maybe. But maybe not. I sure as hell am looking for any reason not to. I mean, any good reason at all. Sell me. Tell me what it is.

Krazy-8: I guess I'd start off by promising that, if you let me go, I won't come after you. That you'd be safe. I guess I'd say what happened between us never happened. And what's best for both parties is we forget all about it. But you know that anybody in my situation would make promises like that. And though in my case they happen to be true, you'd never know for sure. So what else can I tell you?

Walter: I don't know. But you gotta convince me. And you're going nowhere until you do.

Krazy-8: Hey, yeah. Yeah. I'm from here in town, man. ABQ. Born and bred. Never left. Studied business administration over at UNM, got my degree.

Walter: Really? Does that come in handy in the drug trade?

Krazy-8: It doesn't hurt. I was gonna study music originally. Maybe even try out for Oberlin or Berklee. My pops talked me out of it. Said there was no money in it unless I wind up some bullshit rock star, and I didn't have a snowball chance of that, man.

Walter: What does your dad do?

Krazy-8: He owns Tampico Furniture over on Menaul.

Walter: Wait a minute. I know that place. Wait a minute. That's that...they used to have those late-night…

Krazy-8: Those stupid commercials. Yeah, that's him. He's been doing 'em for over 30 years.

Walter: Wait a minute. How did it go? It was, uh Wait, wait, wait. It was Don't let shopping Strain your brain-o Just sing this short refrain-o

Both: Our furniture is bueno. Tampico is the name-o.

Krazy-8: Pretty moronic. But what can you do? It did tend to stick in your head.

Walter: Did you write that, being the musician of the family?

Krazy-8: Hell, no, man. It was my crazy Uncle Alex. He sings it at bars, trying to pick up on women. In his mind, it's like saying, "I wrote Stairway to Heaven.”

Walter: Wait a minute. Tampico Furniture. I think when my son was born we bought his bassinet there.

Krazy-8: We don't sell bassinets there. It's more of a specialty item. We used to sell cribs.

Walter: Oh. Well, a crib, then, okay? Crib. Yeah. No, I remember that. In fact, I remember recognizing your dad from those commercials. Although he wasn't anywhere near as friendly in real life.

Krazy-8: Yeah, no shit. Did he try selling you that extended warranty?

Walter: Yeah, he probably did. And I was probably dumb enough to buy it.

Krazy-8: Yeah, that was his big thing. You ask him for a glass of water, he'll tell you you need an extended warranty on the ice.

Walter: So did you work there, too?

Krazy-8: Only my whole life, up until the day I said "f*ck you" and quit.

Walter: So, uh 16 years would you have been?

Krazy-8: It was after school. Trust me, I was there. Might have even helped ring you up. You and your extended warranty on the crib.

Walter: Small world.

Krazy-8: That it is. The paths we take, huh? Jesse know you got cancer?

Walter: No one but you.

Krazy-8: Not your family?

Walter: No.

Krazy-8: Why not?

Walter: Not a conversation I'm even remotely ready to have.

Krazy-8: That's why you're cooking meth? You want to leave money for your family. Hell, I'll write you a check right now if you let me go. Like I said, Walter, this line of work doesn't suit you, man. Get out before it's too late.

Walter: I don't know what to do.

Krazy-8: Yeah. You do.

Walter: I'll get the key.

Walter: No, don't do this. Don't do this. Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this?

Krazy-8: You're doing the right thing, Walter.

Walter: So you're not angry?

Krazy-8: How do you mean? Angry? No. Live and let live, man.

Walter: That's very understanding.

Krazy-8: Whatever, man. I just want to go home.

Walter: Me, too.

Krazy-8: Unlock me, Walter.

Walter: The moment I do are you gonna stick me with that broken piece of plate? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

Scene: Jesse’s Basement (next day)

Jesse: Hello? Anybody down here?

Scene: Walter’s Classroom

Carmen: Everybody! I need you all to take your seats. Settle down, please. Thank you. I understand that Mr. White is feeling a little under the weather this morning, so you folks are going to have to be making do with me today. And we are going to be watching a very interesting video on carbon. Very important stuff.

Scene: Desert

Steve: So what do you think?

Hank: It's a cook site. Gotta be. Nobody came way the hell out here just to buy. f*re there could have started by accident. Don't look like it was meant to destroy evidence. Got a couple of Dually tracks headed away towards the road.

Steve: So, what, they're in some kind of camper/lab. They accidentally start a f*re, and everybody F.O.'s?

Hank: Yeah, why not? Except why would that little hair-gelled shit leave his car? I-yi-yi, Gomie! It's a culture in decline.

Steve: It's a rich and vibrant culture.

Hank: It's a car that jumps up and down. What the hell? You people used to be conquistadors, for Christ's sake. Smells like a Drakkar Noir factory in here.

Steve: I already searched it. You're wasting your time. Give it up. If this here's a trap car, it's gonna take more than your dumb white ass to find it.

Hank: You are talking to the trap car master, my friend. I'm Rain Man counting his toothpicks.

Steve: Yeah, you're like Rain Man. ret*rd.

Hank: Yeah, baby. Hello, Zippy.

Steve: assh*le.

Hank: I'd say that looks like meth, but it's too damn white. You know what I'm thinking, Gomie.

Steve: Somebody croaked our snitch.

Cop: Hey, agents!

Hank: You got something?

Scene: Flashback of Walter and Gretchen at CalTech

Walter: I don't know. Just doesn't it seem like something's missing?

Gretchen: What about the soul?

Walter: The soul. There's nothing but chemistry here.

Scene: White Residence

Walter: Skyler. There's something I have to tell you.

[Episode 4]
Scene: Police Station

Hank: Operation Icebreaker. How we liking that? We never used that before, did we?

Steve: Isn't it the name of a breath mint?

Hank: What?

Steve: "Icebreakers,” right? Breath mint?

Hank: Nobody's gonna be thinking that. They'll think about a big ass ship in the North Pole, breaking ice.

Steve: Says you. I'm gonna be thinking "Operation Breath Mint."

Hank: I'm thinking "Operation Breath Mint" every time we're on a stakeout together. Your breath could knock a buzzard off a shit wagon. All right. "Operation TBD." Thanks for nothing, Gomie. Anyway. Say hello to Domingo Gallardo Molina, AKA "Krazy-8." Smarter than your average cheese-eater. I turned him out at the street-level, but this dude's like the Jeffersons: Movin' on up. Every small-time dealer he'd throw at us, he'd end up snaking their customers. It turns out he's missing, presumed d*ad. Found his car out in the boonies. Last guy he ratted out was none other than his cousin, Emilio Koyama.

Agent: You thinking the cousin found out and took revenge?

Hank: Could be. Turns out he's missing, too. Normally, I'd say someone did the world a favor. But our snitch's car? Turns out we find two grams of meth in it, we take it to the lab. They come back, they tell us it is the purest they have ever seen. Our chemist was blown away. He said he couldn't do the same thing better. Worse yet, it didn't come out of some superlab in Mexico. We're thinking this was cooked right here, in the Land of Enchantment. Car was abandoned at what appears to be a cook site. This is the only other thing left behind. We're sending it off to Quantico, see if they can pull something off it. Meantime, our guys swabbed the filter element and found the same 99.1% meth. So be on notice. We got new players in town. We don't know who they are, where they come from but they possess an extremely high skill-set. Me personally? I'm thinking Albuquerque just might have a new kingpin.

Scene: White Residence (backyard)

Hank: Jesus. Walt, you're burning the shit out of them. Damn it. Hey, Sky, you got any more chicken? Emeril here is gonna need a fresh pack. All right, looking good.

Marie: Is this low-fat mayonnaise in the cole slaw?

Skyler: I don't know. It's store-bought.

Walter: Hank, you need another beer?

Hank: Does the Pope shit in his hat?

Marie: I don't think that he does, Hank. And I think everybody would like it if you'd stop saying that.

Marie, some more wine, maybe?

Marie: I'm all right, thanks.

Walter Jr: Hey, I want a beer.

Hank: Yeah. I want Shania Twain to give me a tuggie. Guess what? That ain't happening, either.

Walter: How about some more soda?

Walter Jr: Yeah, sure.

Walter: Honey, do you need anything?

Skyler: No, Walt. Thank you.

Walter: Okay. I'll be right back.

Hank: What, are you kidding me? You look like a damn movie star, man. Girls gotta be lining up left and right. Tell him how good-looking he is.

Skyler: He's adorable.

Hank: He don't wanna be friggin' adorable. He wants to be hot. You see what I'm talking about? That's a female perspective. She supposed to say that. Look, a guy doesn't have to look like, uh Charlton Heston I'm talking "Moses" days to get a girl, all right? You just gotta have confidence. Confidence and persistence. That's what I'm talking about. I chased your Aunt Marie here all over creation. I kept bugging her for a date. She kept saying no. What, did I ask you like 50 times?

Marie: It was before they tightened the stalking laws.

Hank: Anyway, how about your dad here? Right there's a good story, Walt. Tell him how you met Skyler.

Walter Jr: Mom was a waitress in Los Alamos. And Dad said that thing to you…

Walter: Actually, your mother wasn't a waitress. It was a summer job, and she was the hostess, and she also worked the cash register. And I used to go in there a lot because it was close enough to the lab where I could ride my bicycle. And once I noticed her it got to be so that I would only go in when I knew she was working. When it was slow, she would lean against the counter, doing her crossword puzzles, but kind of hiding it, right, pretending that she was still working. And once I caught on to that, I would do crossword puzzles while I ate my grilled cheese sandwich. It got so that everyday at lunch, we would both be doing the New York Times crossword puzzle ten feet from each other. Eventually, I caught her looking over at me. So, I began saying, "Excuse me. "Fourteen across, seven-letter word for whatchamacallit. "May I ask what you wrote down?" That got us talking. Boy, I tell you, I was terrible at those puzzles. I don't think that I finished even one of them. But your mother would do them in ink.

Hank: Very smooth. I'll bet you didn't think your old man had it in him? But that's what I'm talking about. That's persistence. You see? Once you set your cap for something, or somebody, you gotta just, you know Skyler?

Walter Jr: Mom, are you all right?

Marie: Shh, honey. It's okay. What's the matter? What is it?

Skyler: Ask him.

Marie: What's she talking about? Walt.

Walter: I have cancer. Lung cancer. It's bad.

Scene: Living Room

Skyler: Ask him how long he's known.

Walter: I guess a month, maybe, or...

Marie: For God sakes, Walt. We're just sitting out there having a cookout like nothing's going on?

Skyler: He made me promise not to tell anybody. Christ, these last 48 hours. And it's the weekend, so I couldn't even get his doctor on the phone.

Hank: Buddy, why I mean, why wouldn't you want to tell anybody?

Skyler: Don't you see? Everybody just wants to help you. We're family. We get through these things together.

Hank: I mean, I don't get, you know, lung cancer? How could that happen? You don't smoke.

Skyler: I'm thinking that this goes back to the applications lab. All those chemicals they had you working around?

Walter: We always took the proper precautions.

Skyler: One time you complained they didn't give you the right kind of I don't know, some kind of ventilation hood or something. And then the headaches.

Walter: Honey, it wasn't that.

Skyler: How do they think they can get away with this? We should hire a lawyer.

Marie: First, let's deal with this. Okay? So what's the next step for Walt? Certainly a second opinion, right?

Skyler: Right. Right. Absolutely.

Marie: Okay. So first thing tomorrow, I talk to my radiologists, we find you the best oncology dream team.

Skyler: I wanna go check on Walt Jr. I'm gonna see if I can talk him into, I don't know, joining us. I really didn't mean for him to find out that way.

Hank: Whatever happens I hope this goes without saying, but whatever happens I want you to know that I'll always take care of your family.

Scene: Jesse’s House

Jesse: Yo, check out these fake Pop Tarts. These are mad tight.

Skinny Pete: No, thanks, man. Pass.

Jesse: Your loss. These are from Canada or something. Imported.

Combo: Yo, what happened to your hallway, man? Did the ceiling fall down or…

Jesse: Oh, yeah I think the house is just settling. It's been caving in left and right. h*t me in the eye. It's bananas.

Skinny Pete: Yo, my pops could fix you up. He's like a contractor or something.

Jesse: Right on. I should grab that number.

Combo: Say, Jesse. You still cook a little crystal?

Jesse: Could be, yeah. You know, from time to time.

Skinny Pete: I heard you lost your partner. Emilio. Didn't he get locked up?

Combo: No, man. He's out. His cousin bailed him out. He skipped town or something.

Jesse: I don't know about any of that. I've been kinda doing my own thing these days.

Combo: But you maybe got some crystal, man? 'Cause I could seriously go for a bowl. You know? Take the edge off.

Skinny Pete: Hell, yeah. Sunday night bowl, yo.

Jesse: Maybe it just so happens that I just recently cooked the best batch ever. Oh, yeah. Came up with this whole new recipe. It's more like a formula. It's like way, way more chemically, you know, it's just the b*mb. But, you know, I don't know, I've been thinking lately I'll just lay off of it for a while. 'Cause lately it's been making me paranoid, so, you know, for, like health wise, just lay off.

Combo: Yo, if you're not into sharing, man, just tell us to piss off. It's cool. We don't need no soap opera.

Skinny Pete: Yeah, man. Whatever.

Jesse: No, no. It's all good. You know, I'm just saying. Hey, I got plenty of pot.

Combo: Yeah, I think I'll bounce, man.

Skinny Pete: Yeah, sounds about right.

Jesse: Hey, yo, yo. Hey, homes. I'm joking. Okay, I'm totally joking with you. You kidding? Sit down. Best scante ever. Grab that pipe.

Scene: White Residence (Bathroom)

Skyler: Do you need some help?

Walter: No, I'm fine, honey. I'm fine. Just Privacy. Thanks.

Skyler: I'm right outside if you need me.

Scene: Living Room

Skyler: Yeah, anytime on Friday is absolutely fine. Thank you so much for working us in. Can I just put that on a credit card? Great. Perfect. Okay, so we will see you at 10:45 on Friday morning.

I mean, Marie really came through for us. She had her boss call and this is good. From here on out, things are gonna...

Walter: What's that we're putting on a credit card?

Skyler: It's just a deposit kind of thing.

Walter: How much of a deposit?

Skyler: It's $5,000.

Walter: Five thousand? And what's that? Just to start? Just to tell me what I already know?

Skyler: Walt, he's not in our HMO, okay? So be it. We'll figure it out. Come on. Don't get hung up on money here. We can always borrow from Hank.

Walter: Absolutely not. No, I just, we're not gonna do that.

Skyler: Well, maybe we can ask your mom. Have you even called her yet? Regardless, you're gonna have to tell her. I'm willing to do it.

Walter: I'll call.

Skyler: I don't want us thinking about money. Money is not the issue here. It's not.

Walter: I'll take care of the deposit. I'll borrow it from my pension.

Scene: Nursery

Walter: What's up? I thought I heard mice. That's all we need, huh? So, what's up, pal?

Walter Jr: What the hell's wrong with you?

Walter: What?

Walter Jr: You're acting all, why are you acting so weird? You're acting like nothing is going on.

Scene: Bank

Ken: Come on! Am I gonna have to come down there and whip your ass? And let me tell you something else. I'm not doing this for charity, right? I'm the best he's got in that office. He knows it, I know it. I expect to be paid to a level comens I said, "Dave, do you think That's less than 10% of what I booked for you guys this quarter. I'm not going to sit here and be disrespected. Oh, he's shitin bricks. Oh, you know he is. Yeah, that man lives in fear. I'll go across town. Hell, I could go anywhere. Hoffman-Gordon-Bradley or Sorcher, even Goldberg-Wayne. They'd make me a partner just for walking in the damn door. That's how ecstatic they'd be. Hells, yes, brother-man! Check this chick out. Who? Buddy, she's a cow. Stacey's a cow. We're talking major barnyard boo-hog. Roll her in flour and look for the wet spot before you h*t that, man. You know?

Teller: Sir? Sir?

Walter: Sorry. Hi.

Teller: What can I do for you?

Ken: Which dude? The dude that looked like a lizard?

Scene: Pinkman Residence

Mr. Pinkman: I don't understand why they're forcing you to choose between the piccolo and the oboe. You show so much promise with both.

Jake: They can't have any switching between woodwinds because no matter how divided up, someone would be left out.

Mrs. Pinkman: Well, rules are rules, I guess.

Mr. Pinkman: Sure, rules and rules. I'm all for that. But I'm telling you, you really shine on that oboe. You have real talent, and I'm not just saying that.

Jake: Thanks.

Mrs. Pinkman: What about Mr. Pemberton? Is he giving you enough individual attention?

Jake: I'd have to say so. He tries to talk to each one of us at least once during every practice.

Mr. Pinkman: That's good. Feedback is important. It's key, I think. Hey, so how was soccer practice?

Mrs. Pinkman: I think that was in our backyard.

Mr. Pinkman: Who's there? What the hell are you doing out here?

Jesse: Hey, Dad. Hey, Mom. Jake. You got new patio furniture. Right on! My leg.

Scene: Kitchen

Mrs. Pinkman: What do you think it could be?

Mr. Pinkman: God knows I'm no expert. I don't know. Uppers, downers? Your guess is as good as mine.

Mrs. Pinkman: I think we should check his arms for needle marks. Do we let him stay? The Presbyterian Church has those meetings. So maybe on condition, you know? If he agrees to attend? I just don't know what to tell Jake.

Jesse: Good evening.

Mrs. Pinkman: Sleep well?

Jesse: What time's, uh what time is dinner?

Mrs. Pinkman: In about an hour. You know, I could wash those clothes if you'd like. They look a little lived in.

Jesse: No, that's cool. Maybe later.

Mr. Pinkman: We are not doing this again.

Mrs. Pinkman: Adam.

Mr. Pinkman: No. We said we'd lay down the law, we lay down the law. We just have to be consistent about it.

Scene: Walter’s Classroom

Walter: You're not taking the bus? All right, well, listen. Give me maybe another 20 minutes and we'll get out of here.

Walter Jr: All right.

Walter: Yeah, good. You know, I just think that things have a way of working themselves out.

Scene: Jake’s Room

Jesse: When did you get this?

Jake: Last May at the year-end assembly. They gave me that one, too. The one on the end.

Jesse: Environmental Consciousness Award. What's that mean? You, like, recycle cans and shit?

Jake: I contacted the Albuquerque Journal and asked what chemicals they use to bleach their paper. They wound up writing an article about it.

Jesse: Right on, little bro! Making mad in-roads with the business community. All right! Now, hey, remember, not all learning comes out of books. Look at you. We should hang out more often. You know, just kick back and chill. I mean, if you ever, like, I don't know, need advice. Because, yo, I mean, I've been through it all. For real. Hey, man, you play the flute?

Jake: It's a piccolo, actually.

Jesse: Dude, play some, play some Jethro Tull.

Mrs. Pinkman: Hey, guys. How are we doing in here?

Jesse: We're good.

Jake: Yeah. Fine, Mom.

Mrs. Pinkman: Well, that's good. That's great.

Jesse: What the hell? You see this? What, am I some criminal or something?

Jake: Whatever.

Jesse: Whatever? What, you think that's okay? Like, "Oh, we can't let that scumbag warp the mind of our favorite son."

Jake: I'm the favorite? Yeah, right. You're practically all they ever talk about.

Scene: Jesse’s Old Room

Jesse: Oh, snap. Awesome.

Combo: Yo, man, it's me. Hey, listen. You know, that product? You got any more of that?

Jesse: Nah, man, okay? I'm done giving out freebies. You want charity, go ask the Salvation Army.

Combo: No, no charity. I got this cousin, he's got him some rich friends. These dudes are in town. They're looking to part-tay. And your stuff is, like, so sweet. So what do you say? You up for making some fat stacks? Because they'll buy everything you got.

Scene: White Residence

Walter: You can't be serious. What the hell are you doing here?

Jesse: Yo, I waited till the ball buster left. I mean, no offense.

Walter: Who sent you? You wearing a wire? You setting me up?

Jesse: A wire? You want a wire? I got a wire. Speak into the mic, bitch! What the hell's wrong with you? A wire. Jesus.

Walter: So who did you tell about...

Jesse: Nobody. What are you, nuts?

Walter: Then why are you here?

Jesse: I don't know. To, like touch base.

Walter: Touch base?

Jesse: Yeah, you know what you call a debrief? Maybe we could, like I thought we could debrief.

Walter: Debrief? Wow, that's what you think we need, to debrief?

Jesse: Yeah, after what happened, it just seems like the thing to do. Kind of, you know, talk about it. We can't talk to anybody else. Anyway, that, and I wanted to tell you how much everybody digs that meth we cooked. Everybody digs the meth we cooked. Seriously, I got dudes that would give their left nut for a little more.

Walter: Great.

Jesse: I'm just saying, if you ever saw your way clear to you know, you and I cooking a little more.

Walter: Get the hell off my property.

Jesse: What? I'm just saying.

Walter: Go and don't come back. Now!

Jesse: All right. You know what? Four grand. Your share from selling that batch. That's why I'm here. Yeah, that's right. I didn't smoke it all.

Scene: Doctor’s Office

Dr. Delcavoli: Non-small cell adenocarcinoma. Stage 3a, which means it's spread from the lung to the lymph nodes. There's no denying it's very serious.

Skyler: But is it curable?

Dr. Delcavoli: I prefer the word "treatable." But the treatments we have at our disposal can be very effective. Without making any promises, I can tell you that the specific course of radiation and chemotherapy I'm going to suggest has been successful. In certain cases, it prolonged patients' lives and even resulted in remission.

Walter: What about the side effects?

Dr. Delcavoli: Well, they can be mild to practically non-existent, or they can be pretty darn awful. It varies from patient to patient. Typically, there's hair loss, which begins a couple of weeks after the start of chemotherapy. You may find yourself unusually fatigued, not much energy. You won't want to get out of bed. You may lose weight due to reduced appetite and certain intestinal issues. Muscle aches and pains, gums get sore and bleed. And, of course, there's the possibility of nausea. Although, we'll prescribe an anti-emetic and try to counteract that. Possible kidney or bladder irritation. You may wind up with increased bruising and bleeding. There may be sexual side effects. Your skin may become dry and irritated.

Scene: Pinkman Residence

Mr. Pinkman: Got anything to say? What do you know about that?

Jesse: Nothing.

Mr. Pinkman: That's not going to fly this time.

Mrs. Pinkman: How many chances have we given you? How many times have we sat right here and had the same conversation over and over again where you look us in the eye and you plead ignorance, and you play on our emotions, and you tell us anything you think we want to hear just so we'll give you another chance? And it makes us feel like fools, every time. Enough, Jesse. Enough.

Mr. Pinkman: We are not going to have this in our house. We need you to leave.

Jake: Thanks for not telling on me. You think I could have it back?

Jesse: It's skunk weed anyway.

Scene: White Residence

Skyler: You know, this is actually very hopeful. Did you hear me? I said this is really very, very hopeful. Can I call them and tell them you'll start next week?

Walter: I just think that we need to discuss it a little more, that's all.

Skyler: What is there to discuss? You're going to get the best treatment and he's the best.

Walter: Well, there's the money discussion. $90,000 out of pocket. Maybe more.

Skyler: There's a way, Walt. There's financing, there's installment plans. I could always go back to work. Walt, there's always a way.

Walter: All right. Skyler, say that there is a way. And we spend all that money, and... Am I supposed to leave you with all that debt? I just don't want emotions ruling us. Maybe treatment isn't the way to go.

Walter Jr: Then why don't you just f*cking die already? Just give up and die.

Scene: Gas Station

Ken: Come on, move your ass. What do I care? Yeah, I'm not worried. I have the best f*cking attorney. I would not want to be on the other side of this one. What the hell? What are you doing? Call somebody, call the f*re people. I don't believe it. You know how much I paid for that? Why is it doing this?

[Episode 5]
Scene: Job Interview

Jesse: Here's my resume. I mean, technically it says "curriculum vitae," which I think is more professional, but, you know, the same thing pretty much.

Manager: Great. But this position truly is a no-experience-necessary kind of thing.

Jesse: Well, and it doesn't really say it here, but I have a solid background in sales. I'm pretty much a self-starter, so.

Manager: That's excellent, but…

Jesse: I really feel I could be a major, major asset to your sales force.

Manager: I'm thinking there's a little misunderstanding. This isn't actually a sales job. I mean, I'd be happy to consider you for a sales position, but our agents need to be licensed, have at least two years on-the-job experience, and usually a college degree. What you would be doing is more like advertising.

Scene: Outside the Building

Badger: Hey, Jesse! Hey, man! Yo, man! What up?

Jesse: Badger?

Badger: Where you been keeping yourself? Nice duds.

Jesse: Yeah. You, too.

Badger: Thanks.

Jesse: Yo, why would you want to do this lame ass job anyway? I mean, no offense.

Badger: Because I'm on probation, yo. Gotta prove to the man I'm rehabilitated. Upstanding citizen. All that shit. It's really good exercise, too. Look. You can't just stand there. You have to spin the arrow. There's all these moves you have to learn, like the helicopter. See? That one's a bitch. I'm not very good at it yet.

Jesse: No, you really opened my eyes to the possibilities. Hey, anyways, thanks for the toke.

Badger: Anytime. Speaking of which, you think you could maybe hook me up with some crystal?

Jesse: Nah, I've been out of the business for a while actually now. Thinking about retiring.

Badger: What? No! That stuff you made is unbelievable.

Jesse: It was pretty awesome.

Badger: Retirement? I can't be hearing this!

Jesse: I had this partner who was helping me cook. I mean, I was doing most of the work, but he was an assh*le, so. Anyway, pseudo's getting harder and harder to come by.

Badger: I can hook you up with some pseudo. Major pseudo. I got channels, bro. We could partner up. No pressure. No pressure. Just think about it, all right? I gotta go. Yo, this way to savings! Save your dollars bills, yo!

Scene: Inside Walter’s Car

Walter: It's a stupid gift.

Skyler: No, it isn't. He'll love it.

Walter: I don't know what I was thinking. Didn't the invitation even say "no gifts"?

Skyler: Walt.

Walter: What?

Skyler: We have to go.

Walter: I know. I'm not complaining.

Skyler: Yes, you are. Look, we need this. We've been through a lot lately, okay?

Scene: Gretchen and Elliot’s House

Skyler: Guess we didn't get the beige memo.

Walter: We're okay.

Skyler: Yes, I look like I'm wearing a prom dress from 1985.

Walter: Honey, you look fine.

Skyler: Walt, this is the only thing I could find that fit me.

Walter: Would you look at that? The invitation said "no gifts."

Skyler: Oh, come on.

Employee: Sir, I'll take that for you.

Walter: Thank you.

Employee: You're welcome.

Skyler: Oh, look, there's Elliott. Let's go say hello.

Walter: Elliott.

Elliott: Walt! You made it.

Walter: Happy birthday. Wouldn't miss it for the world.

Elliott: Thank you. Skyler. Oh, that's right. Great to see you. You look beautiful as always.

Skyler: Well, these days are a little more big than beautiful, but.

Elliott: Of course! Congratulations. That was such great news. Thank you. Gretchen, look who's here!

Gretchen: It's been ages. It's so good to see you. It's really good. Skyler, welcome. Congratulations.

Skyler: Thank you. It's really nice to be here.

Gretchen: When are you due?

Skyler: We're looking at about ten more weeks. Actually, we recently found out that it's a girl.

Gretchen: Congratulations. That's so wonderful. We've been thinking about it for ourselves.

Elliott: Yeah, thinking about it.

Walter: By the way, securing that patent was just amazing. I mean, the work that your company is doing, congratulations, to both of you.

Elliott: Hard work and a lot of luck. A lot of luck. Oh, well, no. Will you excuse us? We gotta say hi. Make yourselves at home. We'll catch up later.

Walter: Sure. Okay.

Elliott: So good you're here. Thank you.

Skyler: Shall we?

Farley: Walt? I thought that was you.

Walter: Farley! Long time no see.

Farley: This Walter White. Back at CalTech, you were just the master of crystallography. I remember this one time, we were stuck on this protein problem for weeks! You just breezed right in and you had one word for us, too. It was synchrotrons, yeah. They generate purer and more complete patterns than x-ray beams. Data collection takes a fraction of the time. This is the White in Gray Matter. Tell 'em, Walt.

Walter: Okay. Well, back when Elliott and I were in grad school, we came up with the name. Schwartz: black. Walter White. So, together they became Gray Matter Technologies.

Farley: Cute, huh?

Friend: So you run the company with Elliott?

Farley: Well, no. No, that's Gretchen and Elliott.

Walter: I gravitated toward education.

Friend: What university?

Elliott: It's a Stratocaster!

Friend #2: Not just any Strat. That's one of Clapton's.

Elliott: No way. "To Elliott. "Sorry about the buckle rash. Eric Clapton." Thank you. This is beautiful.

Skyler: Why is he doing this? What is he, like eight years old?

Gretchen: Here, honey.

Elliott: Thanks. Oh, this is from Walt.

Walter: God.

Skyler: It's okay.

Elliott: Yum-Good Ramen. This is what Walt and I lived on for while we were working on our thesis. They sold them down at Ralsto's in the hardware aisle, right next to the what was it?

Walter: Sterno.

Elliott: The Sterno. Yeah, 10 for $1.99. To this day, I am convinced these noodles were responsible for our success. This was our lifeblood. Where'd you find these? I thought they'd been outlawed years ago. I love it. Thank you, Walt. For the man who has everything.

Elliott: No, no. It was. You remember the fat guy, the fat guy. We used to call him "Snot Trough" because he had that thing under his...what do you call that thing?

Walter: That was Dobkins! That was the same guy who always smelled like chocolate milk. It was!

Elliott: No, no, no, no. It wasn't Dobkins. Anyway, I swear to Christ he used to iron those patches onto the elbows of his Members Only jacket because he thought it made him look more distinguished. Didn't it? No. Well, here's to Snot Trough.

Walter: To Snot Trough. Wherever you may be. God bless him. And you remember the professor who used to hate Robert Wilhelm Bunsen? Yes. All you had to do was mention the Bunsen burner and he was off on a rant. "No, he didn't invent it." You remember the waving? "He just improved it!" You know. It was easy to k*ll.

Elliott: Oh God, I miss this, Walt.

Walter: Yeah. Me, too.

Elliott: Listen, we ought to get together more often.

Walter: Skyler and I would love to have you and Gretchen over for dinner sometime.

Elliott: Sure, yeah, absolutely. But what I mean is that you and I should work together again.

Walter: Are you going to teach high school?

Elliott: No, no. Seriously. What's stopping us?

Walter: Wait a minute. Elliott, what are you? Are you asking me to come work for you at Gray Matter?

Elliott: Yeah. Why not? You'd fit right in. You're brilliant, you've got a ton of experience.

Walter: Well, I wouldn't really know where to begin. I mean God. You have no idea. I spend my days just drawing out atoms on the chalkboard and trying to get these kids to learn the periodic table.

Elliott: Look, I understand. You're a little rusty, but you're not seeing the upside here. We could really benefit from a new set of eyes. You know what it is when you've been trying to crack some problem for months on end. You get tunnel vision. One guy thinking outside of the box, you may be exactly what we need.

Walter: Well, listen, Elliott, your offer is very appealing. It really is. I thank you. But there's something you should know. I have some personal issues.

Elliott: Look, there's nothing we can't work out.

Walter: Well, yeah, but it's complicated.

Elliott: We can help you. We have excellent health insurance. The best.

Scene: Driveway

Skyler: Hey, did you try those prosciutto wrapped figs? They were, like, wow! They were just I must have had about 30 of those suckers. And the seafood table. Did you see that? They had lobster tail, they had crab legs, there was, like, shrimp. Walt?

Walter: What the hell did you say to Elliott? You told him about the cancer, didn't you? Didn't you? I can't believe it.

Skyler: Okay, we were talking. He asked how you were doing, and I am sorry, but I don't have the best poker face these days where that's concerned. He knew something was wrong with you and he pressed me.

Walter: He pressed you. Come on.

Skyler: Walt! When it came right down to it, I didn't know what else to do but tell him the truth.

Walter: The truth? How about you just said "he's fine," huh? Maybe you could've just have said that? "He's fine," and done.

Skyler: I don't like the way you're talking to me.

Walter: I don't like the way you talk about my private affairs to people who are not even in our lives anymore.

Skyler: What exactly did he say to you?

Walter: He offered me a job.

Skyler: What?

Walter: Yes. Kind of like some fig leaf, you know? Some face-saving bullshit that allowed me to generously accept his charity. And then, when I turned that down, he flat-out offered to pay for my treatment. Which is exactly what you expected him to do, didn't you? Didn't you?

Skyler: No. Please. Come on. I did not put him up...Okay, what did you say? Walt?

Walter: What do you think I said?

Skyler: Why? Walt.

Scene: White Residence

Walter: You ready to go?

Walter Jr: I'm taking the bus.

Skyler: Okay bye, honey.

Scene: RV

Badger: Hey, dude, are these b*llet holes?

Jesse: No, man. Those are for, like, you know, ventilation.

Badger: Cool. Nice set-up, huh?

Jesse: Man. This is nothing, man. I used to have, like, twice as much glassware until my dumbass ex-partner drove us into a ditch and wrecked most of it.

Badger: Big ass beaker, huh?

Jesse: Wait, wait. No, that's a, yeah, that's a boiling flask. This is a beaker. Here's a Griffin beaker, here's a volumetric beaker. Here's an Erlenmeyer flask. You got…

Badger: You really know your shit.

Jesse: Well, it's just basic chemistry, yo. So you got something for me?

Badger: Oh, hells, yeah!

Jesse: Okay. We're in business. Right on, Badger.

Badger: Dude, check this out.

Jesse: Jesus, what the hell are you bringing that for?

Badger: Hunting. We might see javelinas.

Jesse: Are you going to help me or what? Badger!

Scene: Outside Convenience Store

Teenager: Let me see the money. Nah, I need five each. Come on, two more. Here.

Walter Jr: What about him?

Teenager: Are you kidding? He looks younger than us.

Walter Jr: Whatever.

Teenager #2: What about that guy?

Walter Jr: Nah, he looks like a businessman.

Teenager: So what?

Walter Jr: So, businessmen are always in a hurry. They're always, like, going to some meeting or something. Seriously, he's just going to say no.

Teenager: This guy. This is our guy. You're up.

Walter Jr: Why do I have to do it?

Teenager: Give me the crutches and I'll go do it.

Walter Jr: Excuse me, hey. We forgot our IDs and we were wondering if you could do us a favor and buy us a six-pack.

Cop: You know, what you're asking is illegal.

Walter Jr: No, it's not?

Cop: Yeah, it is.

Scene: Inside Hank’s Car

Cop: Guess you win the jackpot. This is not how I wanted to spend my night off. Consider this your first and last warning.

Walter Jr: Yes, sir.

Cop: You're lucky you got a good dad here.

Walter Jr: If the other guys hadn't run, I could've talked my way out of it.

Hank: Not cool, man. Not cool.

Walter Jr: What, you never tried to buy beer when you were my age?

Hank: No, I'm talking about you calling me and not your father. How do you think that will make him feel?

Scene: White Residence

Skyler: I don't even know what to say to you. Just go. I'll deal with you later.

Hank: Where's Walt?

Skyler: I haven't seen him since this morning. Your guess is as good as mine.

Hank: Listen, do me a favor, all right? Don't tell him about the kid. Just a teenager trying to score some beer, you know? You know. Just growing pains. I mean, he finds out his dad's sick, he starts acting out, you know? First the pot, and then this.

Skyler: The pot?

Hank: You told me he was smoking reefer.

Marie: That's what Skyler told me. I mean, you may as well have.

Skyler: I wasn't talking about Walter, Jr. I was talking about Walt.

Marie: Excuse me?

Skyler: He admitted it. He said he liked it.

Hank: Walt? I didn't think he had it in him.

Skyler: It's like he's not himself lately. I mean, why would anyone in their right mind choose not to do treatment? Especially when it's completely paid for? Why is he doing this? You know what we need to do? What we really need to do is sit him down, all of us, and get everything out on the table. Talk it all through.

Marie: You mean an intervention?

Skyler: No, no. Just a family meeting where everyone can voice their concerns and be heard.

Scene: RV

Badger: You are a genius, bro! This cankenstein is unreal! When we get back, I'm gonna burn that dollar bill suit 'cause we're gonna make some mad dough!

Jesse: It's not right.

Badger: What do you mean it's not right?

Jesse: It's cloudy. It's not supposed to be cloudy. That last time, it was glass.

Badger: So what? Cloudy, not cloudy, it looks good enough to me.

Jesse: "Good enough."

Badger: Yo, what are you doing? Are you out of your mind? I totally would've smoked that!

Jesse: It's not for you, it's for our customers. They're gonna demand a certain standard.

Badger: What? What are you? What?

Jesse: We'll just do it again until we get it right.

Scene: White Residence

Skyler: Walt, please have a seat and join us.

Scene: RV

Jesse: We can do better.

Badger: Don't you f*cking think about it! Three entire pounds of pseudo wasted! You know how long I had to spin that stupid sign?

Jesse: Get off me, psycho!

Badger: Helicopter, bitch! Open the door! Come back here, you bitch! I'm gonna mess you up!

Scene: White Residence

Skyler: I really need to understand your thought process because clearly I don't. I feel that this decision you've made is not only not in your best interest, it's not in the best interest of our entire family.

Walter: Look, Skyler.

Skyler: Not yet. Please. I have the Talking Pillow. Everybody gets to speak their minds, remember? And then, you'll get your chance. Money has always been an issue for us, I'll give you that. But now that Elliott is more than willing to pitch in, I know, I understand that it's hard for you to accept help. Maybe it's the way you were raised. But, honey it's okay to lean on people now and again. You need this treatment, and nothing can stop you from getting it, except you.

Walter: Am I allowed to respond?

Skyler: In a minute. I think we need to go around the circle first. Hank, would you like to start?

Hank: Yeah. Okay. Well, what I'll say is…

Skyler: No, take the Talking Pillow.

Hank: All right, look, buddy. I know I don't get to tell you this enough, but I care about you a hell of a lot. This cancer thing, let's just face it. You know, you were dealt a shit hand. But sometimes your luck can change. I mean, I can't tell you how many times I was, you know, I started with a shit hand and I ended up with a full house. Okay? I mean, the key is, you gotta hang in there. Man, you gotta keep placing your bets. Keep placing your bets.

Marie: Hank, what the hell are you saying?

Skyler: Please, Marie, let him talk. That's what we're here to do. Please. Go on, Hank.

Hank: Right, well, look at it this way, okay? It's the bottom of the 9th. Bases are loaded. You're up. But you got a bum arm. Right? There's no frickin' way you're gonna h*t a homer. So you can either let the pinch hitter take the bat, or you can hold onto your pride and lose the game. Get what I'm saying?

Walter: No.

Hank: You got your pride, man. I get it. Okay? I get it. If this Daddy Warbucks wants to chip in, I'm with your old lady on this one. I say take the money and run, you know? Somebody wanna to take this thing? Here.

Skyler: Yes, Walter Jr, I'm sure you have about a million things to say, probably, and now is your chance. Go ahead. Just let it all out.

Walter Jr: This is bullshit.

Walter: Hey, come on.

Skyler: It's all right. Talk. Tell your dad how you feel.

Walter Jr: I'm pissed off.

Skyler: Tell him.

Walter Jr: I'm pissed off, 'cause you're being, you're a p*ssy. You're, like, ready to give up. What if you gave up on me, huh? This here? All the stuff I've been through, and you're scared of a little chemotherapy?

Marie: Me, personally? I think you should do whatever you want to do.

Skyler: What?

Marie: You told us to be honest about our feelings. Walt's the one with cancer. It's his decision. It's not up to any of us.

Skyler: Why in the hell would you do this?

Marie: I wasn't planning on agreeing with Walt. But after sitting here and listening to you all talk about his future like he has no say in it.

Skyler: He's not gonna have a future if he doesn't get treatment.

Marie: I am a medical professional. I x-ray people in treatment every day. I see them every day, and you know what? Some of them are absolutely miserable.

Skyler: Marie.

Marie: I'm sorry, but it's true. And some of them don't wanna spend their last weeks or months being picked at by doctors. But they got talked into it by their families.

Hank: Could I get the pillow back? I agree with Marie on that. What? Maybe Walt wants to die like a man.

Skyler: I don't want him to die at all! That's the whole point of this. So either help, or leave!

Marie: Skyler, I just wanted to do you the courtesy of giving you my honest opinion.

Skyler: You know, Marie, this is not a debate club. This is my husband's life.

Marie: I make one simple observation.

Skyler: My husband's life we're talking about!

Hank: Ladies. Come on.

Skyler: How dare you?

Walter Jr: This is so stupid.

Walter: All right, I've got the Talking Pillow now. Okay? We all, in this room, we love each other. We want what's best for each other, and I know that. I am very thankful for that. But what I want, what I need, is a choice.

Skyler: What does that mean?

Walter: Sometimes, I feel like I never actually make any of my own. Choices, I mean. My entire life, it just seems I never you know, had a real say about any of it. Now this last one, cancer all I have left is how I choose to approach this.

Skyler: Then make the right choice, Walt. You're not the only one it affects. What about your son? Don't you wanna see your daughter grow up?

Walter: Of course, I do. Skyler, you've read the statistics. These doctors, talking about surviving. One year, two years, like it's the only thing that matters. But what good is it, to just survive if I am too sick to work, to enjoy a meal, to make love? For what time I have left, I want to live in my own house. I want to sleep in my own bed. I don't wanna choke down 30 or 40 pills every single day, lose my hair, and lie around, too tired to get up and so nauseated that I can't even move my head. And you cleaning up after me? Me, with some d*ad man, some artificially alive, just marking time? No. No. And that's how you would remember me. That's the worst part. So that is my thought process, Skyler. I'm sorry. I just, I choose not to do it.

Scene: White Residence (Morning After)

Walter: All right.

Skyler: All right what?

Walter: I'll do the treatment. It's gonna be okay.

Scene: Waiting Room

Skyler: The lady from the billing office said they usually bill the insurance company directly, but since our HMO is not paying for it, we can pay up front with a credit card.

Walter: Good.

Skyler: And then Elliott will send a check.

Walter: I will take care of it.

Nurse: Walter White?

Walter: Yes.

Skyler: Okay. See you in a minute.

Scene: Inside Walter’s Car

Walter: Elliott.

Gretchen: Walt, it's Gretchen.

Walter: Oh, hey. Hey, Gretchen. How are you? You know, it was really great seeing you two the other day. What a party.

Gretchen: Elliott told me about the cancer. I'm so sorry.

Walter: Well, you know, it is what it is, I guess.

Gretchen: I don't know what to say except I'm always here for you. Both of us are. We wanted you to know that.

Walter: Yeah, well, thank you.

Gretchen: Walt, Elliott's told me he had offered to pay for the treatment. You have to accept. That money, as far as we're both concerned, that belongs to you. Even the name of our company, it's half yours. Walt Is this about you and me?

Walter: Gretchen, I really appreciate the offer. I do. But we're fine. As it turns out, the insurance came through after all. So I am covered. Well, anyway, I really appreciate it. Thank you.

Gretchen: Good, that's good news.

Walter: You know, that really was a great party.

Gretchen: Keep in touch, okay?

Walter: Sure. Sure. Thank you for calling.

Scene: Jesse’s House

Jesse: Yo!

Walter: You wanna cook?

[Episode 6]
Walter: Let's get something straight. This, the chemistry, is my realm. I am in charge of the cooking. Out there on the street, you deal with that. As far as our customers go, I don't wanna know anything about them. I don't want to see them. I don't want to hear from them. I want no interaction with them whatsoever. This operation is you and me, and I'm the silent partner. You got any issues with that?

Jesse: Whatever, man.

Walter: No matter what happens, no more bloodshed. No v*olence.

Scene: Walt’s Chemotherapy

Skyler: Walt? You all right?

Walter: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm okay. You know, honey, you really don't have to…

Skyler: Look, I like being here with you.

Walter: I'm only saying that, I'd be okay with it, really, if you want to go. You know, actually, it would make me feel a little better knowing that you were there when Walter Jr. gets home from school.

Skyler: Okay. All right. You'll call me when you're finished?

Walter: Oh, yeah.

Skyler: And have you been in touch with Elliott? Because I haven't seen a check from him.

Walter: Yes, I got it.

Skyler: Really?

Walter: It came, yeah. Yeah, it came last week, and I put it right into my credit union account, all taken care of it.

Skyler: Good.

Walter: So we're good. We're good.

Scene: Bank

Walter: Could you not deposit this until Monday? Thank you.

Scene: Pharmacy

Pharmacist: Call if the discomfort is too much. Otherwise, we'll see you next week.

Walter: Yeah.

Scene: Walter’s Classroom

Walter: Chemical reactions involve change on two levels: matter and energy. When a reaction is gradual, the change in energy is slight. I mean, you don't even notice the reaction is happening. For example, when rust collects on the underside of a car. But if a reaction happens quickly, otherwise harmless substances can interact in a way that generates enormous bursts of energy. Who can give me an example of rapid chemical reaction? Hint, hint. Right here.
Student: Like an expl*si*n?

Walter: Yes. Good. expl*si*n. expl*si*n are the result of chemical reactions happening almost instantaneously. And the faster reactants, i. e. , expl*sives, and fulminated mercury is a prime example of that, the faster they undergo change, the more violent the expl*si*n. So expl*si*n. Okay, listen. Why don't you start reading on your own from the top of chapter 7, all right?

Scene: Restroom

Hugo: You okay? I got it, Mr. White. Don't worry. You got kids to teach.

Walter: Thanks, Hugo.

Scene: Group Therapy

Skyler: He's starting to lose weight, which is tough to see that. You know, to feel the difference when I put my arms around him. Can I talk to him?

Counselor: Of course.

Skyler: Walt when you don't let me in, when you don't tell me what's going on, I think it's like I feel like you don't even want me around sometimes.

Walter: No.

Skyler: And recently these afternoons, when you're coming home so late and we're just left wondering where you are.

Walter Jr: Yeah, Dad. What's up with that?

Counselor: Walt, is there anything else you're holding back from your family? Now's the time to share.

Walter: Well I like to be alone, I mean at times, and it's not about you, really. It's just that sometimes it feels better not to talk at all about anything, to anyone.

Counselor: Alone time can be helpful for some types. Maybe knowing what you do when you're alone might make it easier for your family to be more accepting of whatever it is you do alone.

Walter: Well I like to go on walks a couple of times a week, maybe more, after work. And I really enjoy nature. You know, the cacti, the vegetation, that kind of thing. It's really very therapeutic.

Scene: Desert

Jesse: Yo! You okay? Did you breathe that shit?

Walter: No. I'm just dizzy.

Jesse: Come here. Sit down, sit down.

Walter: I'm burning up.

Jesse: Take this off. Sit down. Get some air.

Walter: Oh, God. Yeah, that's better.

Jesse: When were you going to tell me?

Walter: Tell you what?

Jesse: Cancer. You got it, right?

Walter: How did you know?

Jesse: My aunt had one of those dots on her, to target the radiation. What is it in your lung? I'm your partner, man. You should have told me. That's not cool, okay? Not at all. What stage are you?

Walter: 3a.

Jesse: Gone to your lymph nodes.

Walter: Your aunt. How bad was she when they caught it?

Jesse: Bad enough. She didn't last long.

Walter: How long?

Jesse: Seven months. I get it now. That's why you're doing all this. You want to make some cash for your people before you check out.

Walter: You got a problem with that?

Jesse: You tell me. You're the one that looks like you just crawled out of a microwave. You going to be able to finish the batch?

Walter: Yes.

Jesse: All right.

Walter: No. You do it.

Jesse: Me?

Walter: Yeah. What happened to your mad skills? Go on. Here. You do it. You can do it. If you have any questions, I'll be right out here.

Jesse: The next time, put an ice pack on your head during chemo. My aunt said it helped with the hair loss.

Scene: Parking Lot

Hank: What's this? Christmas? This the one we found way out in the boonies, the cook site? Holy shit.

Steve: What?

Hank: Lab pulled up an imprint of some old writing that used to be on the inside. Old Magic Marker or something.

Steve: Yeah? What's it say?

Hank: "Property of J. P. Wynne Chemistry Lab." That's Walt's school.

Scene: Desert

Walter: We were supposed to start at 3.

Jesse: I'm out there making fat stacks, man. Chill. Hey. Prepaid cell phone. Use it.

Walter: How much is this?

Jesse: 26 big ones.

Walter: Is that all? $26,000?

Jesse: No, that's 26 hundred, and your share is 13, minus 25 bucks for that phone.

Walter: How much meth did you sell?

Jesse: Nearly an ounce.

Walter: Last time I checked, there were 16 ounces to a pound. You smoked the rest?

Jesse: I've been out there all night slinging crystal. You think it's cake moving a pound of meth one teenth at a time?

Walter: Why are you selling it in such small quantities? Why don't you just sell the whole pound at once?

Jesse: To who? What do I look like, Scarface?

Walter: This is unacceptable. I am breaking the law here. This return is too little for the risk. I thought you'd be ready for another pound today.

Jesse: You may know a lot about chemistry, but you don't know jack about slinging dope.

Walter: Well, I'll tell you, I know a lack of motivation when I see it. You've got to be more imaginative, you know? Just think outside the box here. We have to move our product in bulk, wholesale, now. How do we do that?

Jesse: What do you mean, to a distributor?

Walter: Yes. Yes. That's what we need. We need a distributor now. Do you know anyone like that?

Jesse: Yeah, I mean I used to until you k*lled him.

Walter: So who took Krazy-8's place?

Jesse: Some guy named Tuco. A bad ass, from what I hear.

Walter: Tuco, okay. So then just go talk to Tuco.

Jesse: Right. Like, "Hello, sir. Hey, I know you don't know me, but would you be interested in a felony quantity of methamphetamine?"

Walter: Well, yes, but maybe with a little more salesmanship, perhaps?

Jesse: You just don't get it, man. This guy's O.G.

Walter: What does that mean?

Jesse: Jesus, look, he's upper level, man. He's not going to do business with some dude he doesn't know. You don't understand the way it works. You can't just bum rush some high-level iceman and start cutting deals, okay? It's risky. You need an intro. You need someone to vouch.

Walter: Well, who introduced you to Krazy-8?

Jesse: Emilio. That's only because I knew him from, like, third grade. We can't talk to Emilio, either.

Walter: All right, all right.

Jesse: Look, I'm telling you, Mr. White, it's too risky. Okay? I mean, we're making money. Why can't you just be satisfied with the way it is?

Walter: Jesus! Just grow some f*cking balls!

Scene: Bank

Teller: Wait till Monday again?

Walter: Yes, please. Thank you.

Scene: Restroom

Hugo: Mr. White.

Walter: Thank you, Hugo.

Scene: Walter’s Classroom

Carmen: Knock-knock.

Walter: Oh, hey.

Carmen: How are you feeling, Walt?

Walter: Good.

Carmen: Are you up for having a visitor?

Hank: Hey, buddy.

Walter: Hank.

Carmen: Let me know if you need anything.

Walter: I will. Thank you, Carmen.

Carmen: No problem.

Hank: Damn. That chick's got an ass like an onion. Makes me want to cry.

Walter: So what are you doing here?

Hank: Well, I had some questions I wanted to run by you, work-related. You okay? I could come back later.

Walter: No, no, no, no. I'm fine. Everything's fine. What do you mean work-related, though?

Hank: Do you recognize that?

Walter: No.

Hank: That was used to cook meth. Found that on some Indian land about 40 miles from here. Old label on the inside used to say J. P. Wynne Chemistry Lab.

Walter: Really? I don't understand how that came from here.

Hank: I was hoping you could help me. We found it near an abandoned car belonging to one of our snitches.

Walter: A snitch?

Hank: Yeah, one of our confidential informants. Went missing a while back. No body yet, but we're pretty sure he's, you know. Probably chopped up in little pieces and fed to the buzzards. Anyway, any respirators like that go missing lately?

Walter: No. No. No, I mean, not that I know of.

Hank: I'll need to take a look at that inventory.

Walter: Sure. I got a list hanging on the wall.

Hank: You mind if I take a look at your storeroom?

Walter: Not at all, no. Be my guest.

Hank: Right. So who's got keys?

Walter: Well, the science faculty, the staff, Carmen, the vice principal has the master, and me.

Hank: How about students?

Walter: No, no. No students have keys.

Hank: I should hope not. My question is do any know where you keep them?

Walter: I don't think so. No. Besides, I keep them right here in my pocket anyway, so…

Hank: Walt, look, I know they're your students, but, do not underestimate them. Big mistake. Are there any other respirators?

Walter: Uh, no.

Hank: Because I'm counting six. Inventory says eight. Glassware looking a little sparse.

Walter: Is it?

Hank: Yeah. You're missing a couple of Erlenmeyer flasks at least. Oh, yeah. A 5,000 milliliter round bottom. Meth heads love to brew in this, baby. Going to answer that?

Walter: No, it's just, no, I don't.

Hank: Maybe it's Skyler. She's in trouble or something. Don't ignore it on my account. Answer it! C'mon, I got stuff to do. Jeez.

Walter: Okay. Hello.

Jesse: Yo. What's up, Mr. W?

Walter: Speaking.

Jesse: Bad time to talk?

Walter: Absolutely.

Jesse: All right, so just listen. You know that guy we were talking about, Tuco? Turns out my boy Skinny Pete was in the same cellblock with him over at Los Lunas. So we got our in. We're hauling a pound to the dude right now.

Walter: Okay, then. Thank you very much for calling. My doctor is very solicitous.

Hank: Look, buddy, the last thing I want to do is get you in hot water, but some meth monkey had a feeding frenzy in here, okay? You got to keep a better watch over your turf.

Walter: I will.

Hank: We don't want people to start wondering about you, right?

Walter: Right. No. Right. Absolutely not.

Scene: Tuco’s Place

Jesse: So you're sure you're tight with this guy?

Skinny Pete: Two nuts in a ball sack, yo. Yo, man, I'm Skinny Pete!

Jesse: Maybe this isn't such a good idea, yo. Come on.

Skinny Pete: Atta man. That's what's happening. Yo, Tuco's expecting us. No need, man. Me and Tuco go back. Tuco. What's happening, my brother? Sick crib, yo. You been keeping it real since you been sprung. What's it been, like a year?

Tuco: This your boy?

Skinny Pete: Yeah, Jesse. The dude with the glass I was telling you about.

Jesse: Hey, man. Yeah, I've heard a lot about you.

Tuco: Break out the ice. Take a bump.

Jesse: No worries, man. I'm no cop.

Tuco: I said h*t it.

Jesse: All right.

Tuco: Boo ya! Woo! This kicks like a mule with his balls wrapped in duct tape. Woo! Where'd you get it?

Jesse: I cooked it.

Tuco: Bullshit! Who you working for?

Jesse: No one, man. I mean, I have a partner that I cook with, but that's it.

Tuco: All right. We got a deal.

Skinny Pete: See? I told you Tuco would hook you up.

Jesse: Cool. I haven't said how much.

Tuco: All right. How much?

Jesse: 35 large for the pound.

Tuco: Well, you're a little light, ese. It's all right. Don't sweat it. It's all good. It's good. Go on. Get out of here.

Jesse: What about the money?

Tuco: You'll get it. This is a consignment operation.

Jesse: You want me to float 35 G's?

Tuco: You don't trust me?

Jesse: No, no. Hey, it's not that, man. It's just, you know, I don't do business that way.

Tuco: Tough shit! The deal is done!

Jesse: You said this was cool. Get money for meth. Cash up front.

Skinny Pete: Don't front, dude. Tuco's good for it.

Tuco: I don't need your punk ass to vouch for me!

Jesse: Come on! Oh, come on!

Tuco: All right, you brought me some really clean crystal. Do you really want your money up front? Up front. Nobody moves crystal in the South Valley but me, bitch!

Scene: High School Parking Lot

Hank: Good morning, Hugo. Don't mind if I call you Hugo, Hugo?

Walter Jr: Is that Uncle Hank? Uncle Hank's arresting Mr. Archuleta.

Carmen: This doesn't make any sense to me at all. I don't understand.

Hank: I got two words for you: background check. How about that?

Scene: Walter’s Bathroom

Jesse: Yo, yo, yo. 148-3369, representing the ABQ. What up, biatch? Leave it at the tone.

Walter: Where the hell are you? Call me back.

Skyler: Hey, Walt.

Walter: Yeah?

Skyler: Hank's about to deal.

Walter: Okay. I'll be right there.

Scene: Living Room

Hank: All right. Let's see what the turn brings us.

Marie: You're looking good, Walt. Your color's better.

Walter: Yeah? Thanks.

Skyler: He's actually on the pretty strong stuff now. Dr. Delcavoli is trying to talk him into taking some time off from work, but...

Walter: Well, actually, I just talked to Carmen this morning, and they're getting a substitute for a few weeks. I just didn't have a chance to tell you. Sorry.

Hank: Your bet, tough guy.

Walter Jr: Check.

Skyler: Yeah. Check.

Marie: Check's in the mail. 10 million.

Hank: Red's 25 million. Blue's 10.

Marie: Then 25 million because that's how I roll.

Walter Jr: Hey, Uncle Hank, why were you arresting Mr. Archuleta the other day? He's a pretty cool guy.

Hank: Well, turns out that he has a record. Yeah. Couple of possession beefs. We figure he was the guy that was stealing your school's chemistry gear. I mean, you know, he had a key. Fit the profile. When we searched his truck, we found a big old fat blunt, which goes to prove old Huge Hugo ain't so cool after all. It's to you, Walt.

Walter: Yeah, I'll call.

Skyler: I can't believe the school system didn't know about this guy's record. I mean, that's pretty scary. How could something like that just slip through the cracks?

Walter: I don't know. I mean, for what it's worth, Hugo just doesn't strike me as the thief.

Hank: Yeah, well, nothing personal, Walt, but you wouldn't know a criminal if he was close enough to check you for a hernia. Now, that said, we got a search warrant, and we tore old Hugo's house apart. Turns out he's a major league pothead. But he didn't raid your chemistry set. You hiding something?

Walter: I'm in.

Walter Jr: Yeah, I got nothing.

Skyler: I'm out.

Marie: I'm out.

Hank: Yowsa! When old "holes in her purse" bails, you know you're in deep. Looks like it's you and me, buddy.

Walter: What's going to happen to him? Hugo.

Hank: Well, I mean, he's going to lose his job, like he should. Probably spend a couple months in County, as it's not his first rap. I'm waiting. You going to man up, or you're going to puss out?

Skyler: Hank.

Hank: What? Sorry.

Walter: I'm all in.

Hank: No. You bad, bad, bad, horrible liar. What are you smoking there, huh? You got a heart? You got the flush, don't you? Nope. Not falling for it, buddy. I fold.

Marie: Talk about anti-climactic. Your cards couldn't have been that bad. Oh, my God. You threw away an ace...

Hank: What are you doing? Don't.

Marie: ...and a cowboy, for...a handful of nothing.

Scene: Walter’s Bathroom

Walter: Who is this? I was dialing Jesse Pinkman. Well, where is he, then?

Scene: Hospital

Skinny Pete: You the guy?

Walter: Yeah, I'm the guy. How is he?

Skinny Pete: Got some busted ribs and like that. Got messed up pretty good. I was all like "Damn, Tuco, chill, ese." I don't know what got into him. Seriously. Oh, he's out, man, way out. They got him doped up big-time. So you're the cook, huh? Yo, I didn't catch your name.

Walter: Tell me about this Tuco. Tell me everything about him.

Scene: Kitchen

Walter: Good morning. Would you pass the butter, please?

Walter Jr: Bad ass, Dad.

Scene: Tuco’s Place

Walter: You Tuco? I want to talk to Tuco, and I'm not leaving until I do.

Tuco: What's your name?

Walter: Heisenberg.

Tuco: Heisenberg. Okay. Have a seat, Heisenberg.

Walter: I don't imagine I'll be here very long.

Tuco: No? All right. Be that way. It's your meeting. Why don't you start talking and tell me what you want?

Walter: $50,000.

Tuco: Oh, man! 50 G's? How you figure that?

Walter: 35 for the pound of meth you stole and another 15 for my partner's pain and suffering.

Tuco: Partner. Oh, yeah. I remember that little bitch. So you must be Daddy. Let me get this straight. I steal your dope, hmm? I b*at the piss out of your mule boy! And then you walk in here, and you bring me more meth? That's a brilliant plan, ese. Brilliant.

Walter: You got one part of that wrong. This is not meth.

Tuco: Are you f*cking nuts?

Walter: You want to find out?

Tuco: No-Doze, Gonzo, calma! Calma. Calma. You got balls. I'll give you that. All right. All right. I'll give you your money. That crystal that your partner brought me, it sold faster than $10 ass in TJ. What say you bring me another pound next week?

Walter: Money up front.

Tuco: All right. Money up front. Sometimes you gotta rob to keep your riches. Just as long as we got an understanding.

Walter: One pound is not going to cut it. You have to take two.

Tuco: Hey, what is that shit?

Walter: Fulminated mercury. A little tweak of chemistry.

[Episode 7]
Superintendent: In closing, I can tell you we take this very seriously. APD as well as the DEA. Stopping the manufacture and sale of methamphetamines remains one of our highest priorities. And the theft of lab equipment from your school is also receiving our highest attention. Rest assured, no stone will go unturned in our search for the person or persons responsible for this. If you have any questions, now would be the time.

Parent: You're talking like you haven't caught anybody yet. What about the janitor that was dealing drugs at the school?

Carmen: There is no indication that this individual was selling drugs. He was arrested for having a small amount of marijuana in his car, not in the school. And he's since been fired.

Parent: I heard he had a record. I'd like to know how he got a job here in the first place. Why wasn't there a background check?

Carmen: There was one. We're currently reviewing our hiring policies.

Parent: You better be doing more than that. He was arrested in front of my daughter.

Parent: This guy was stealing the lab equipment, right?

Cop: That's not our thinking at this time. We are looking at others who had access, not limited to the maintenance staff.

Parent: Are you saying there was a break-in? Do we know exactly when this happened? I mean, could it have been during school hours?

Cop: We haven't been able to establish a date or time, but there is no sign of breaking or entering.

Parent: Whoever took it had a key? We're talking inside job? Someone who's still at the school?

Cop: At this time I'm not able to discuss the details, but what I can tell you is that we have some very good people working very hard on this case.

Parent: I'm sorry, Officer. But that sounds like double-talk. We're trying to protect our children. You have to level with us.

Cop: Really, we are giving you all the information we have.

Parent: You know what I'd like to see in this school? Drug-sniffing dogs.

Parent: Yeah, dogs, and metal detectors, and locker searches, and strip searches.

Superintendent: Our district has strict policies.

Parent: I heard about this school in Canada. They arrested one of their groundskeepers with drugs. And the next day they found out over half of the students were high on LSD.

Parent: LSD? When were you gonna tell us about the LSD?

Carmen: No. Please. No one said anything about LSD.

Parent: What about the equipment that was stolen?

Carmen: The equipment was taken from our chemistry department. And I would like someone to give us some specifics. Walt?

Walter: Yeah.

Carmen: Mr. White is currently on medical leave. But as he's chair of the science department, he's made a very special effort to be with us here. And I'd like to take a moment to thank him for that. Could you please tell us more about the equipment that was taken? Please.

Walter: Yes. And thank you. The inventory list for the missing labware is as follows: one 5,000 milliliter round bottom boiling flask, one Kjeldahl-style recovery flask, two full-face respirators, some sep funnels, a sill head with a thermometer holder.

Scene: Parking Lot

Skyler: Where did that come from? And why was it so damn good?

Walter: Because it was illegal.

Scene: Jesse’s House

Real Estate Agent: The basement. Unfinished, of course. But just look at all this space. You gotta think rec room, media room. Just imagine all the things you could do down here. Now remember, you're buying for this fantastic neighborhood. Big lawns and shade tress. Walking distance to the country club.

Buyer: What happened there?

Realtor: Bit of a fixer, but this house has great bones.

Realtor: You know what? We're zeroing in. I've got another listing, brand-new, right around the corner. Hi. Hi. It's by appointment only.

Walter: I'm here to see the owner.

Realtor: He's in the recreational vehicle.
Scene: RV

Jesse: Yo, it's appointment only!

Walter: How you feeling?

Jesse: About as good as you look. Jeez, you look like Lex Luthor.

Walter: Listen, I visited you in the hospital, but you were asleep.

Jesse: Yeah, Skinny Pete said you wanted Tuco's address. Acting like you were all out for blood. You are alive, so obviously you wised up.

Walter: No, I did go see him.

Jesse: Bullshit.

Walter: Are you selling your house?

Jesse: I got two dudes that turned into raspberry slushies and flushed down my toilet. I can't even take a proper dump in there. The whole damn house has got to be haunted by now. You didn't actually go see Tuco?

Walter: Here. That is seventeen-five. Your half of the 35,000. Plus there's an extra 15 in there. It's all yours. You've earned it.

Jesse: You got this money from Tuco.

Walter: Yeah.

Jesse: So Tuco gave you this is what you're saying.

Walter: We made a deal.

Jesse: You made a deal?

Walter: That's right.

Jesse: Wait. Why would you make a deal with that scumbag? You see what he did to me?

Walter: Because I think that we can do business together. We came to an understanding.

Jesse: No way, man! Okay? No understanding.

Walter: Take a look at the money in your hand. Now just imagine making that every week. That's right. Two pounds a week.

Jesse: Without even talking to me, you told this insane ass clown d*ad-eyed k*ller that, uh that we would give him two pounds a week?

Walter: We'll just scale up our operation. We'll add a few more hours.

Jesse: Don't talk to me about hours. What about pseudo, man? How are we gonna get that? You think the meth fairy is just gonna bring it to us? It takes me a week to get this stuff. I'm driving all the way out to Las Cruces to meet up with my smurfs.

Walter: Smurfs?

Jesse: Dudes who go to the drugstores and get a couple boxes at a time and then sell them to me. And that's maybe only good for, like, maybe a half-pound worth. See, that's the bottleneck in your brilliant business plan. All right. Of course you would have known that if you would have just asked me.

Scene: Doctor’s Office

Dr. Delcavoli: Well, here we are again.

Skyler: Here we are.

Dr. Delcavoli: Skyler, you look great.

Skyler: Thank you.

Dr. Delcavoli: You must be, what, six, seven months? How goes it?

Skyler: It's great other than waddling to the bathroom every five minutes.

Walter: The baby shower's next week. It'll be good to have a day that's just about Skyler.

Dr. Delcavoli: Very nice.

Skyler: Thank you.

Dr. Delcavoli: Well, Walt, I see you've committed to the hair loss.

Walter: Yeah.

Dr. Delcavoli: How do you feel?

Walter: Oh, okay. You know, pretty decent actually.

Skyler: His color is better. You know, his energy. And he's even more physical.

Dr. Delcavoli: More physical?

Skyler: Well sexual. Frisky, actually. I mean, that's got to be a good sign, right?

Dr. Delcavoli: Sure, I'll take that. Right, Walt?

Skyler: Couldn't that mean that the chemo is working?

Dr. Delcavoli: Realistically, it may just mean that we've got the anti-emetics tuned right. Truth is, until Walt's finished this round of chemo and we look at a new PET scan, we just can't say for sure.

Skyler: Isn't there anything else we could be doing? I've been wondering about alternative medicine. I mean, Eastern healing. You know, holistic.

Dr. Delcavoli: Well, I can't speak to its efficacy. But as long as it doesn't interfere with our treatment, anything that helps my patient have a better outlook, a better comfort, is fine by me.

Skyler: So you're saying it's all psychological. It doesn't make any real difference.

Dr. Delcavoli: Having a better outlook can make a tremendous difference. But it's also important that we manage our expectations.

Scene: Junkyard

Walter: What?

Jesse: A junkyard? Let me guess, you picked this place?

Walter: What's wrong with it? It's private.

Jesse: This is like a non-criminal's idea of a drug meet. This is like, "Ooh, I saw this in a movie. Ooh, look at me."

Walter: So where do you transact your business? Enlighten me.

Jesse: I don't know. How about Taco Cabeza? Half the deals I've ever done went down at Taco Cabeza. Nice and public. Open 24 hours. Nobody ever gets sh*t at Taco Cabeza. Hell, why not the mall? You know, wait at the Gap. "Hey! It's time for the meet. You know, I'll put down the flat-front khakis, head on over, grab an Orange Julius.” Skip the part where psycho lunatic Tuco comes and steals my drugs and leaves me bleeding to death.

Walter: Look, you don't have to be here for this. Okay? I mean, seriously. I'm okay.

Jesse: Nah, I'm no p*ssy. I'm good.

Tuco: Mr. Clean and his boy. I'm sorry that I had to tune you up. Respect, ese. You gotta give it to get it. Hey, what are we doing way the hell out here? What, they close the mall or something? Heisenberg, come on, break it out. That's it? That's all you got?

Walter: We had some production problems.

No Doze: Point five-three.

Tuco: I thought you was a player. You told me two pounds, and now you waste my time with these Chiclets? 17 and a half. Minus the half for wasting my time.
Walter: Hey, come on.

Tuco: What, you're gonna argue? You got something to say? You're doing business like a couple little bitches.

Walter: I want all of it. 70 grand.

Tuco: What did you say?

Walter: You like this product, and you want more. Consider it a capital investment.

Tuco: Loco bald f*ck. 52 and a half, 25 points vig.

Walter: Vig?

Jesse: Interest. Weekly.

Walter: Okay. That's $65,625 with interest. 1.875 pounds.

Tuco: No. 2 pounds. Next Friday. And no production problems.

Walter: Can you handle 4 pounds?

Tuco: Listen, old man. Talk is talk. But owing me money that's bad.

Jesse: What did you just do?

Scene: Jesse’s House

Jesse: 4 pounds. 4 pounds cause’ 2 pounds wasn't bad enough. We're talking 200-300 boxes of sinus pills. There ain't that many smurfs in the world.

Walter: We're not going to need pseudoephedrine. We're going to make phenylacetone in a tube furnace, then we're gonna use reductive amination to yield methamphetamine, 4 pounds.

Jesse: So no pseudo?

Walter: No pseudo.

Jesse: So you do have a plan. Yeah, Mr. White! Yeah, science!

Walter: Okay.

Jesse: What's this?

Walter: That is a shopping list. Getting some of those items may be challenging.

Jesse: "One autotransformer, hy...hydrous methyl...methylamine, two 35 M&M tube furnaces."

Walter: That's MM: millimeter. One 70-millimeter would be fine, but they're hard to come by, so.

Jesse: "40 grams thorium nitrate?” Yo, Mr. White, I can't even pronounce half this shit. You know what? Count me out. I'm leaving town. I'm moving to, like, Oregon or something.

Walter: Jesse, Jesse, listen to me. Today is the first day of the rest of your life.

Jesse: What are you doing?

Walter: This is the first day of the rest of your life, but what kind of life will it be? Will it be a life of fear, of "Oh, no, no, no, "I can't do this," of never once believing in yourself?

Jesse: I don't know.

Walter: Listen. These things? We need them. And only you can get them for us.

Scene: White Residence

Walter Jr: Okay, it's ready. There you go.

Marie: Hi, baby. I'm your Aunt Marie. Now, you already know that because when you watch this 20 years from now, I will look exactly the same as I do now. I know it is amazing. I have aged shockingly well, haven't I? Anyway, welcome to your baby shower, Esmeralda!

Walter Jr: Esmeralda?

Marie: Esmeralda. That's your name, and you heard it here first. Now, that is your wonderful, handsome older brother. Show her, older brother, your face. Okay. Not right up the nose. Back to me. There's your mommy! Hello, Mommy! And look! There you are, Esmeralda! Wake up, baby! Time to party!

Skyler: Easy. Believe it or not, Esmeralda, right after the party, your name was changed to Holly. And I believe, Hank, that was around the time that we took Aunt Marie to the insane asylum.

Hank: Yeah, yeah. I dropped her off at the curb. Then I married Shania Twain and lived happily ever after.

Marie: There's Daddy! Speak, Daddy! Say hello to your daughter.

Walter: Holly, I am very proud of you, and I think about you all the time. Wherever you go, whatever you do in life, always know that you have a family who loves you very, very much. Cheers.

Everyone: Cheers!

Skyler: Oh, my God, it's so cute. Oh, Carmen, it's oh, look. Look at that. It's adorable. I love it, Carmen. Thank you.

Carmen: You're so welcome, honey.

Skyler: Thank you. Look at the little feet.

Marie: From me. And Hank.

Skyler: What nice wrapping paper. Marie always finds the best wrapping paper.

Marie: I do.

Skyler: Okay. Let's see what this is. Exciting. Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. It's a tiara. Marie, is this…

Marie: White gold and several carats' worth of zircons.

Skyler: Oh, Marie, you spent too much on this. You shouldn't have. You really, really shouldn't. But it's so, it's really, it's sparkly. Sparkly! Like wow! Thank you.

Hank: Hey, listen, Walt, you got anything stronger than beer?

Scene: Backyard

Hank: Sorry, man. You know, after 200 presents, it just gets kind of old. That's nice stuff.

Walter: It is, isn't it?

Hank: I got just the thing to go with that. I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

Walter: No, no, no, no. It's okay. You mind if I have one?

Hank: You think it's a good idea?

Walter: Hank, I've already got lung cancer.

Hank: Okay. You got me there.

Walter: Thanks. Cuban.

Hank: I did a little favor for an FBI guy.

Walter: Now, I was under the impression that these were illegal, hmm?

Hank: Yeah, well, sometimes forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest, doesn't it?

Walter: It's funny, isn't it? How we draw that line.

Hank: Yeah? What line is that?

Walter: Well, what's legal, what's illegal, Cuban cigars, alcohol. You know, if we were drinking this in 1930, we'd be breaking the law. Another year, we'd be okay. Who knows what will be legal next year?

Hank: You mean like pot?

Walter: Yeah. Like pot. Or whatever.

Hank: Cocaine? Heroin?

Walter: I'm just saying it's arbitrary.

Hank: Well, you ought to visit lockup. You hear a lot of guys talking like that. "Hey, man, why'd you bust me with these 14 bales of ganja? It's all gonna be legal next year when Willie Nelson's president." Shit, buddy, it doesn't only go one way, either. Sometimes there's stuff that's legal that shouldn't be. I mean, friggin' meth used to be legal. Used to sell it over every counter at every pharmacy across America. Thank God they came to their senses on that one, huh?

Walter: Yeah.

Scene: Walter and Skyler’s Bedroom

Walter: Nice party.

Skyler: A tiara. A white gold tiara for a newborn baby.

Walter: Yeah.

Skyler: You know, I think she got that at Gertrude Zachary's in Nob Hill. I mean, that thing must have cost, like, what, $500 or $600. You know what? I think I'm going to return it.

Walter: You sure? She's bound to find out.

Skyler: Well, maybe I can explain to her that we need a Diaper Genie more than a white gold baby tiara.

Walter: You know, I've been thinking about what you said to Dr. Delcavoli about alternative medicine.

Skyler: Don't worry. I'm not going to mention that anymore.

Walter: What I mean is that maybe there is something to it. Here. Look. They do this Navajo sweat lodge up by Farmington. Healing ceremony. It's supposed to be good for your lungs. I'm not saying that I believe in it, but you know, it might be an experience.

Skyler: Really? You? In a sweat lodge?

Walter: I was thinking about driving up on Friday, coming back Sunday. I mean, if you're okay with it.

Skyler: Well, of course I'm okay with that.

Walter: Okay.

Scene: Jesse’s Garage

Jesse: Sweat lodge?

Walter: Yeah.

Jesse: I'm already sweating. Help me out.

Walter: Okay. Right. Excellent. This is excellent. Very good work.

Jesse: Damn straight.

Walter: Okay. Hydrogen. Electrolytically produced, yes?

Jesse: Yeah, like you asked. I mean, this crap wasn't easy to get. It was expensive.

Walter: Methylamine. Where's the methylamine? I don't see the methylamine.

Jesse: Yeah, well, that's where I ran into some trouble.

Walter: What kind of trouble?

Jesse: Well, half this crap I could just buy, right? But this methylamine, not so easy. They got it locked down tight. But I did find some pros who will rip it off for us. But they want 10 grand.

Walter: So what's the problem? You have the money.

Jesse: No, had. I already spent almost the whole wad. I mean, I got, like, 2 grand left. I told you, all this crap was expensive.

Walter: So these thieves, did they say where they would be stealing it from?

Jesse: Yeah, a chemical supply place south of town. They got guards and security cameras, big ass steel doors. That's why these dudes are charging so much. What?

Walter: So why don't we just steal it ourselves?

Jesse: Yeah? How are we going to do that?

Walter: With this.

Scene: Jesse’s Kitchen

Jesse: So what's this stuff called again?

Walter: Thermite.

Jesse: And that will cut through a lock? Because this is supposed to be one big ass lock.

Walter: In World w*r II, the Germans had an a*tillery piece, it's the biggest in the world, called the Gustav g*n, and it weighed a thousand tons. And the Gustav was capable of f*ring a 7-ton shell and hitting a target accurately 23 miles away. I mean, you could drop b*mb on it every day for a month without ever disabling it. But you drop a commando, one man, with just a bag of this and he could melt right through and destroy that g*n forever.

Jesse: Jeez!

Walter: So yes. I think it will cut through any lock we're likely to find.

Scene: Gertrude Zachary’s

Manager: You'd like to return this?

Skyler: It's very nice, but yes. Well, it is from the store, isn't it?

Manager: Oh, yes. It's from this store. Do you happen to have a receipt?

Skyler: No. I don't. It was a gift.

Manager: A gift. Mr. Wilson, could you step over here, please? Mr. Wilson, I'd like you to watch this lady while I phone the police.

Skyler: Excuse me?

Manager: Ma'am, this item is stolen, as I'm sure you know. Come with me, please.

Scene: Manager’s Office

Manager: Oh, yes. I intend to press charges. Please do. We'll be here.

Skyler: Look, I've never stolen anything in my life, all right? I told you. That tiara was a gift. A baby shower gift.

Manager: So who gave it to you, then?

Skyler: I don't think I have to tell you that.

Manager: You don't have to tell me anything. You can talk to the police, and I can tell them how my daughter-in-law remembers showing this particular item to a tall blonde woman who, when her back was turned, walked right out the door with it. So there.

Skyler: Oh, yeah? Then I can talk to the Channel 3 News. Yeah. I can tell them how you people, without a shred, without a modicum of evidence, illegally detained an innocent pregnant woman in a dank storeroom.

Manager: This is my office.

Skyler: I feel I'm being held hostage. Furthermore, I'm not getting enough air back here. I don't think I can breathe. Oh, my God. Oh, no. I'm going into labor.

Scene: Outside of Zachary’s

Marie: You've reached Marie. Do the beep thing.

Skyler: Marie? It's Skyler. I just left Zachary's. I need to talk to you immediately.

Scene: Chemical Supply Warehouse

Walter: Where's the guard?

Jesse: He's supposed to be coming by. You think he already passed?

Walter: I don't know. There he is.

Jesse: Yeah, I see him.

Walter: Wait till he passes.

Jesse: Okay, it's clear. What the hell is this?

Walter: It's all they had.

Jesse: Then you go to another store. If this is all they had, wrong place.

Walter: Just put it on. Okay. This is it. Oh, God. Damn. Duck. Duck.

Jesse: What? He's not supposed to come back. What's he doing? Oh, God. He's going to the crapper.

Walter: Oh, God. Carry your bag.

Jesse: What? What are you doing?

Walter: Okay, there is it.

Jesse: Is this going to be loud?

Walter: We'll find out in about ten seconds. Stand back.

Jesse: Jesus!

Walter: Where are the gallon jugs?

Jesse: I don't know.

Walter: God!

Jesse: What?

Walter: Let's just take this. Come on. Come on. What the hell are you doing opening the door?

Jesse: How are we going to take this thing out?

Scene: RV in Jesse’s Driveway

Walter: How is it going to be any different?

Jesse: Can I just try it?

Walter: Fine, fine, go ahead. Jesus.

Jesse: Okay. All right. Yeah, baby. See? Eat it, okay? I'm the king. I'm the king. No, no, no. That didn't sound good.

Walter: Well, this thing's not going anywhere.

Jesse: We're not cooking in my damn driveway. I tell you that.

Scene: Jesse’s Basement

Walter: What part of slow it down did you not understand?

Jesse: You talk too much. It's heavy, man.

Walter: You got to wait for me. Okay. That's good, that's good. Now just bring it up. Easy, easy, easy. Okay. Your real estate agent, when is she supposed to come back?

Jesse: Shit. Yo, I don't know. I'll make damn sure she doesn't. Good call, yo.

Walter: All right. Keep the temperature steady at 425 degrees. We'll need to run it two more hours to have enough to make 4 and a half pounds.

Jesse: 4 and a half, not 4?

Walter: Two pounds pays Tuco back. Four and a half pounds puts us $44,000 ahead. Each.

Jesse: Right on, man. Right on.

Walter: With the amount of methylamine that we got last night, we could make well, for the foreseeable future.

Jesse: How long is that going to be? I mean in your situation. How much cash do you need?

Walter: More.

Jesse: Someone's in my yard.

Walter: Was there, by any chance, scheduled for this afternoon an open house?

Jesse: I left her a message, man. It's not my fault.

Walter: I don't care how you do it. Just keep them out of here. Do you understand?

Jesse: Yeah.

Walter: Go.

Scene: Clothing Store

Skyler: You know you can't duck me forever.

Marie: What?

Skyler: Come on. I left you, like, 15 messages. When I went to your office, you snuck out the back way.

Marie: I didn't sneak. I was going to lunch. Jeez, Skyler, what are you, the paranoid police?

Skyler: Marie, I have never been so humiliated in my life. That tiara. They accused me at Zachary's of shoplifting it.

Marie: What were you doing at Zachary's?

Skyler: I was returning it.

Marie: You were returning it. Why would you return it?

Skyler: It just wasn't...Marie, what is wrong with you? Can you please tell me that? Can you tell me why you'd do such a thing? What does that mean? Does that mean you don't know?

Marie: That means that I have no idea what the hell you're even talking about.

Skyler: You have no idea what I'm talking about. The shoplifting. No idea? You're not going to admit this, are you?

Marie: I can't really admit to something when I have no knowledge of what it is that I'm admitting.

Scene: Jesse’s House

Real Estate Agent: Don't forget to sign in. Thank you. Thank you.

Buyer: Excuse me. I'd just like to see the basement.

Jesse: Yeah, well, it's occupied.

Buyer: It's not a bathroom. I just want to see the basement. What's the big deal?

Jesse: Yo, you ain't seeing the basement, bitch! You got that? Is that sinking in? Now b*at it. All of you all. House is not for sale! Get the hell out!

Scene: White Residence

Skyler: So how was it? Was it an experience?

Walter: Yeah. It was definitely an experience.

Skyler: What's that smell?

Walter: Yeah. It's sacred Navajo herbs and, hey, is everything okay?

Skyler: No. Not really. Actually, not at all. You know that tiara that Marie gave us?

Walter: Yeah.

Skyler: Well, she stole it. Yeah. I practically got arrested trying to return it at the store.

Walter: Oh, my God.

Skyler: She refuses to admit it. She refuses to apologize. I don't know what to do.

Walter: Oh, well. People sometimes do things for their families.

Skyler: People sometimes do things for their families? And, what, that justifies stealing?

Walter: Yeah.

Skyler: That must have been some sweat lodge. Have you been listening to the words coming out of your mouth?

Walter: What would you do if it were me?

Skyler: What do you mean if it were you?

Walter: If it were me, what would you do? Would you divorce me? Would you turn me in to the police?

Skyler: You don't want to find out. Do you want something to eat?

Walter: No, thanks.

Scene: Junkyard

Tuco: What is this shit? This is blue.

Walter: We used a different chemical process, but it is every bit as pure.

Jesse: It may be blue, but it's the b*mb.

Tuco: Tight! Tight, tight, yeah! Blue, yellow, pink. Whatever, man. Just keep bringing me that. Come on. And what did I say, man? This guy can cook! You're all right, man. You're all right. We're going to make a lot of money together.

No Doze: Just remember who you're working for.

Tuco: What did you say?

No Doze: I'm just saying they got to know that they're working for you.

Tuco: Like they don't already know that? Are you saying that they're stupid?

No Doze: No, I'm just saying.

Tuco: Oh, yeah. So you're not saying that they're stupid. So I don't understand. Are you saying that I'm stupid?

No Doze: No. Come on, Tuco. I'm just saying.

Tuco: No, you're just speaking for me! Like I ain't got the damn sense to speak for myself! Is that it? Is that what you're doing?

Walter: Tuco. Hey, why don't we all just relax, huh?

Tuco: Heisenberg says relax. Orale, homes. I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed. Damn, man! Look at that! Look! Yeah. That's messed up. Okay, Heisenberg! Next week.
